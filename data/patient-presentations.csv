Abdominal mass,PRES001,B,A,A,"A palpable abdominal mass may be apparent to a patient/parent or identified by the GP when a patient presents with other symptoms such as a change in bowel habit, urinary symptoms, weight loss, vomiting or pain. Think about the symptoms you would ask about, and the key features that are of importance in different groups such as children, patients who ovulate, patients who have undergone surgery or have underlying diagnoses such as inflammatory bowel disease or prostatism. Practice abdominal examination where you can, learning to identify and characterize the location, extent and consistency of abdominal masses including organomegaly. Speak to your GP tutor about what investigations you might utilise including bloods, FIT samples, urinalysis and imaging. Review the 2WW criteria for referral directly to specialities such as Gynaecology, Gastroenterology, Urology and USS.","Presentations of abdominal masses in secondary care can cover a broad range of pathologies. In the acute setting you are most likely to encounter abdominal masses in the emergency department or acute surgical units where the mass is usually accompanied with abdominal pain. In these situations, a thorough history and abdominal examination is essential to help establish the location and the cause of the abdominal mass. You may also encounter patients who have bowel obstruction secondary to an abdominal mass. These patients are often very unwell, in addition to abdominal pain they often experience nausea, vomiting and reduced/no flatus. On examination their abdomen is usually tender and bowels sounds are usually absent or tinkling. This is surgical emergency due to the impending risk of bowel perforation.

Causes of abdominal masses can be broken down into malignant and non-malignant causes.
Non-malignant disease processes include hernias, abdominal aortic aneurysm, diverticulitis, Crohn’s disease and ovarian cyst in women. Various malignancies can present with an abdominal mass, including stomach, colorectal, renal, and liver cancers. ", ,"Older patients with abdominal masses are commonly referred to Geriatric Clinics and the usual differentials apply, but commonly constipation may be a cause. Malignancy, hernia, abscess, AAA are also commonly encountered. Severe kyphoscoliosis may also distort the usual anatomy causing 'false' palpable masses.","Oncology case-based teaching 5 - Kidney case,CCM lecture 2 - Abdominal X-Ray,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Gastrointestinal examinations,Interventional Radiology in Vascular Emergencies lecture,Liver disease,Liver disease,Liver disease,Oncological Imaging in the Era of Precision Medicine lecture,Ovarian Disease,Ovarian Disease,Ovarian Disease,Prescribing snapshot: Prescribing drugs for administration via enteral tubes,Recorded teaching session -  Abdominal Pain - Dr Marianne Phillips,""Recorded teaching session - GI exam, Liz Goode"",Slide deck - Abdominal Pain,""Slide deck - GI Exam, V Mulcahy"",Oncology extension teaching resources",18,Surgery,,Abdominal Mass,"Cancer,Child health,Gastrointestinal including liver,Obstetrics and gynaecology,Surgery"
Abdominal pain,PRES002,A,A,A,"Identifying an underlying cause in patients who have difficulty communicating, those at the extremes of age and in pregnancy requires careful practice and skill, and the recent shift to remote consultation has exacerbated this. Consider elements of the narrative, examination and risk assessment that would suggest the acute abdomen requiring urgent surgical or gynaecological assessment and ambulance transfer from home or the surgery. Be aware of common causes such as infantile colic, constipation, gastroenteritis, and dysmenorrhoea that may be possible to manage conservatively, and when atypical presentations would prompt concern. Speak to the GP tutor about how they approach abdominal pain, who they bring to the surgery for review and what symptoms or signs would prompt further investigation. Discuss the options- which blood tests are appropriate, and what is their sensitivity/specificity like? Who would you check urine and blood glucose in? Review the local 2-week wait criteria, and consider which patients merit an endoscopy, urgent direct access CT or USS. Abdominal pain is a very common symptom in children and young people- be aware of features that may suggest malignancy, or surgical emergencies such as appendicitis. Get familiar with using a patient's electronic records to identify possible contributing factors to their presentation, such as medication and conditions such as diverticular disease or aneurysms. ","Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting symptoms in healthcare – especially in A&E. Its time-course can be acute, subacute or chronic, and can vary in severity – from benign to life-threatening, affecting all age ranges. One example you may see is a 10-year-old child in the paediatric assessment unit with subacute abdominal pain in the umbilical region for 5 days followed by localisation to the right iliac fossa with fevers and reduced oral intake. Another example is that of a 20-year-old sexually active female who is not on contraception, has missed her last two periods and has now presented with acute abdominal pain and per-vaginal bleeding to A&E. A final example may be an elderly gentleman who is an inpatient on a geriatric ward. He takes opioid analgesia for his lower back pain and has not passed stools for several days but continues to pass wind - his per-rectal exam shows impacted stools. A useful starting point with assessing any patient presenting with abdominal pain is whether the patient is haemodynamically unstable or not, as the former will indicate a life-threatening differential and will determine the urgency of any relevant investigations and interventions. A systematic history taking for such a patient would include characterisation of the pain (SOCRATES) as well as a systemic screen e.g. fevers, night sweats, weight loss – being aware that an O&G history is vital for any female patient. Examination would include an abdominal and PR exams +/- cardiorespiratory exam +/- gynaecological exam. Initial investigations may include a urine pregnancy test (mandatory in females of child-bearing age), urinalysis +/- MCS, blood tests including group & screen +/- crossmatch, AXR (if suspecting bowel obstruction) and US/CT imaging. Further investigations can include endoscopy or diagnostic laparoscopy. There are a myriad of differentials to consider for abdominal pain and a careful synthesis of history, examination and investigation is required to refine your differential and to enact focused management.","Abdominal pain is one of the most frequent complaints in children presenting in primary or secondary care. Common causes for abdominal pain include viral gastroenteritis or constipation. Children also commonly present with functional abdominal pain. However, the differential diagnosis includes multiple organic causes that need to be considered through a thorough history and examination. Try to think about red flags (for example bloody stool, acute onset, localized or night time pain) that help identify those cases that need urgent attention and/or intervention.","Again, the usual differentials apply, but commonly seen causes include: constipation, ileus, IBS, hypercalcaemia, ischaemic bowel, diverticular disease and late onset coeliac disease. It is important to distinguish between acute vs chronic vs acute on chronic pain.","03 Chronic liver disorders - video,04 Biliary liver disorders - slides,04 Biliary liver disorders - video,05 Vascular liver disorders - slides,Acute Abdominal Pain,Acute Abdominal Pain,Acute Abdominal Pain,Acute Kidney Injury webinar - Eve Robertson,Alcoholic hepatitis webinar - Matt Hoare,Analgesia and NSAIDs,Analgesics lecture,Article: Arlt W; Society for Endocrinology Clinical Committee.

Abdominal swelling,PRES003,B,A,A,"Patients may describe a sensation of swelling or distension or bloating, or abdominal swelling may be apparent on examination for other symptoms such as loss of appetite, abdominal pain, urinary and bowel symptoms or breathlessness. Consider the questions you would ask and what red flags are important. Practice examination of the abdomen, and think about the role of imaging and investigations including TTG and Ca125. Review the NICE cancer pathways and consider where patients should be referred to. Speak to your tutor about what approaches should be taken with patients who report a sensation of bloating or swelling, but in whom all investigations are reassuring.","Abdominal swelling is a common and potentially serious presentation within secondary care. Given the number of organs present within the abdomen, causes of abdominal swelling are far-ranging; from more conventional surgical causes of swelling (such as bowel obstruction) to less conventional (such as splenomegaly secondary to a haematological pathology). Consequently, there is potential to see patients with abdominal swelling across most medical and surgical specialties. Taking a detailed and specific history and examination is therefore crucial to delineate the nature of the abdominal swelling, in combination with other investigations. Keep in mind the 5 Fs when approaching a patient with abdominal swelling (Fat, Faeces, Fluid, Flatus, Foetus) to remind yourselves of the most likely cause, and remember that weight loss in the context of abdominal swelling is concerning for malignancy.", ,"AAA; ascites; malignancy, heart failure; ","04 Biliary liver disorders - video,05 Vascular liver disorders - slides,CCM lecture 2 - Abdominal X-Ray,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Gastrointestinal examinations,Gynae oncology,Inflammatory Bowel Disease Companion notes to recorded lecture - Dunecan Massey,Inflammatory Bowel Disease Recorded Lecture - Dunecan Massey,Intestinal Failure Companion notes to recorded lecture - Dunecan Massey,Intestinal Failure Recorded lecture - Dunecan Massey,Liver disease,Liver disease,Liver disease,Lymphadenopathy,Lymphadenopathy,Lymphadenopathy,Malabsorption presentation - Anita Gibbons,Oncological Imaging in the Era of Precision Medicine lecture,Recorded teaching session -  Abdominal Pain - Dr Marianne Phillips,""Recorded teaching session - Diarrhoea, Constipation and IBS - Dr Catriona Davidson"",""Recorded teaching session - GI exam, Liz Goode"",Slide deck - Abdominal Pain,""Slide deck - GI Exam, V Mulcahy"",""Slide deck - IBS, Diarrhoea and Constipation"",Swelling of the Abdomen,Swelling of the Abdomen,Swelling of the Abdomen,Oncology extension teaching resources",28,Surgery,,"Abdominal Distension,Ascites","Cancer,Gastrointestinal including liver,Obstetrics and gynaecology,Surgery,General practice and primary healthcare"
Abnormal development/developmental delay,PRES004,C,A,A,"Whilst the primary care team are involved in caring for those children who  are known to the neonatologists and paediatricians (for instance, when there have been abnormalities or a diagnosis from birth), they may also be the first point of contact for concerned parents or health visitors at any stage. Be aware of the scheduled points of contact for children and young people- such as the six week check and immunisations- and how GPs might begin to assess a child when parents have concerns. Consider the ongoing role of the GP for children who are under the care of the paediatricians, and their place in the MDT, that includes places of education and social services. Think too about the important matter of supporting a child's caregivers and wider family.","Childhood Development’ is usually defined as the functional skills a child develops between birth and the age of 5. Developmental skills are split into 4 (or more!) subsections: gross motor, fine motor, speech and language, and social and emotional skills. Within each sub-section there is a timeline of developmental milestones that children reach by certain ages on average (eg we would expect a child to start walking by 12 months). There are also “red flag” ages where we would expect almost all children to have acquired a particular skill by this age- not meeting a milestone by a “red flag” age would merit referral for further assessment (eg not walking unaided by 18months of age would be concerning). Global developmental delay is when there is delay in all domains of development- it can be an early sign that a child needs intensive support from a multidisciplinary team and may give diagnostic clues about conditions or syndromes that may be affecting the child. Developmental regression is when a child loses previously acquired milestones- this may be evident in children with autism spectrum disorder where children lose their previously acquired language and social skills, or in Rett syndrome where a child loses their fine motor and language skills.
You could watch and participate in a new-born physical examination and hearing assessment on the post-natal wards- here you may notice the very first signs of developmental delay such as asymmetrical posturing or a baby not startling to loud noise. In outpatient and community paediatric clinics you will see children being referred from primary care with signs of developmental delay and regression- speech & language and physiotherapy clinics would be a particularly good place to see how these disciplines assess and manage developmental delay.","It is important to understand the normal pattern of development in children. Knowledge of developmental milestones in the different domains and the normal age range these are attained will help you recognize infants and children with potential delay. There are many causes for developmental delay and this requires careful evaluation. While developmental delay is commonly used in younger children <5 years of age, in older children the term learning disabilities is more commonly applied. Children with developmental delay may be recognised during routine screening by the health visitor or present to primary or secondary care. Try to think about how you would perform a developmental assessment, which questions to ask parents and what you can elicit directly from the child. Try to perform a developmental assessment during your child health placement.", ,"(PH2) Inequalities - Children,Childhood development,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Immuno-deficiency 1,Immuno-deficiency 1,Immuno-deficiency 1,Immuno-deficiency 2,Immuno-deficiency 2,Immuno-deficiency 2,Intellectual Disability Psychiatry,Maternal & Child Health: Neurodevelopment problems in children and young people,Paediatrics - Child protection,Year 5 seminar: Abnormal Neurodevelopment",13,Child health,,Abnormal development/ developmental delay,"Child health,Neurosciences"
Abnormal eating or exercise behaviour,PRES005,B,A,A,"General practice is often the first place that patients will present with disordered eating, sometimes with insight, sometimes as a result of concern from parents/carers or school, but you may have cause for concern when seeing patients with other symptoms such as weight loss/gain, low mood, fatigue, osteoporotic fractures or deliberate self-harm. Have a low threshold for thinking about an eating disorder as a differential and think about how you would begin to discuss this- measures such as BMI and the SCOFF questionnaire should not be used as the sole method for determining if referral and treatment is required. What physical and behavioural signs will you look for? The NICE guidelines urge prompt referral as early specialist multidisciplinary treatment improves outcomes- what does the pathway and local support like? What is your GP tutor's experience of managing eating disorders in the community, and how do they maintain the clinician-patient relationship? Patients with eating disorders are at high risk of medical emergencies despite appearing well and having normal blood parameters. How are patients monitored, and suicide risk addressed- have a look at the MEED guidance.","Eating disorders are common in children and young adults due to behavioral issues associated with binge eating or restricted eating because they are concerned with their appearance and weight. Bulimia nervosa, in which the patient frequently has episodes of uncontrolled eating followed by vomiting, and anorexia nervosa, in which the patient fears gaining weight, are two examples of eating disorders. You may encounter these patients in your pediatrics postings with a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and other findings of malnutrition with associated emotional and psychological issues such as anxiety and depression. Blood tests reveal electrolyte imbalance, changes in blood sugar levels. You can also find such cases in your psychiatric postings where someone has a history of self-harm then you need to review for physical and mental health risks. Eating disorders are also suspected in cases with chronic illness who have gastrointestinal or endocrine problems (such as diabetes) or if someone has complications such as osteoporosis, then needs consultation with the appropriate specialist team.", ,"In older people conisder the following differential to account for abnormal eating patterns: depression; dementia, delirium, oral candidiasis; poor dentition; immobility causing problems obtaining or making food; social isolation; dry mouth secondary to anticholinergics; altered taste; polypharmacy; preference for sweet foods in advanced dementia.

Abnormal sweating,PRES006,B,A,A,"A common problem, excess sweating may be difficult to distinguish from hot flushes and flushing, and it is important to be able to distinguish identify those people who potentially have a serious underlying cause. Consider the important questions to ask when assessing for malignancy or infection. Be aware of the relevance of geography and a travel history, menopausal/postnatal state, and new medications that may cause sweating such as hypoglycaemics, hormonal agents and antidepressants. The breadth of an examination is potentially huge, including assessment of lymphadenopathy, thyroid state, cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological exams. Speak to your GP tutor about how the history may inform this examination, and how they go about such assessments given the time restrictions and remote assessments within primary care. Discuss what findings would lead to blood tests including HIV, imaging, testing for TB and urinalysis. Consider how fever of unknown origin is investigated and which patients might require CT scans, echocardiography, bone marrow biopsies and assessment for rare causes such as phaeochromocytoma and carcinoid. Ask your tutor what secondary care support they have locally for these patients with a non-specific but potentially concerning symptom. Conversely, which patients would you monitor and reassure? Review the management options for primary hyperhidrosis, and sweating in palliative care patients.","Abnormal and excessive sweating is also known as hyperhidrosis, is classified based on location (focal or generalized) and cause (primary or secondary). Patients with excessive generalized sweating all over are frequently encountered during acute admission or in the wards, along with other acute symptoms when there is other secondary pathology affecting thermoregulation or exaggerated response to sympathetic drive. This includes case such as infection( or septic) with temperature changes, MI( severe chest pain), endocrine (hyperglycemic, hypoglycemic with night sweats , hyperthyroidism), metabolic condition, drugs, anxiety. Usually this settles with the treatment for the underlying condition. If patient presents only with excessive sweating in focal areas which is commonly encountered in your dermatology postings.

Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis),PRES007,A,A,A,"All the primary care team have to be trained to recognise and deal with anaphylaxis in patients, following the administration of a drug, or from patients walking in with deteriorating symptoms. Find out where the emergency trolley is kept and what medications may be required in an emergency. More common are milder presentations, such as rash, itch and upper respiratory tract and eye symptoms. Practice taking histories about drugs, contact, inhalant and food allergens. Speak to community pharmacists about over the counter management of common allergies including hayfever and eczema, and understand what else can be done in primary care- including use of steroids- and where referrals to allergy specialists or dermatologists may be required. Be aware too that patients may ask for ""allergy testing"" when it is not indicated, and speak to the GPs about how they manage such requests. Be aware of Cows Milk Protein Allergy, how to spot it and differentiate it from other common feeding issues in babies.","Acute allergic reactions and anaphylaxis are life treating conditions that require immediate recognition and treatment. The incidence of A&E presentation for acute allergic reaction is high and varies by region, season, and age. The spectrum of symptoms ranges from mild urticaria to abdominal cramps to laryngeal swelling and respiratory failure. A thorough history should be taken to identify the trigger, however this should not delay treatment. In patients who develop an acute allergic reaction whilst in hospital a drug hypersensitivity should be considered. All patients that present to hospital should have their known allergies recorded in order to avert clinical incidents. You should identify and familiarise yourself with the crash trolley in your area and revise regularly the ALS anaphylaxis guidelines.","Children with severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis will commonly present to the emergency department. It is important to know how to recognise and manage anaphylaxis as when left untreated this can be a life-threatening condition. Refer to the anaphylaxis algorithm which is discussed as part of life support courses. Nut allergies are a more common cause of anaphylaxis in children. Children can also present with milder allergies that can be outgrown, such as cow’s milk protein allergy. It can be challenging to diagnose allergy and testing has only limited value. History is often a powerful tool when exploring allergy symptoms and try to understand exactly what allergen the patient been in contact with at what point in time and the relationship with symptoms emerging.

Altered Appetite,PRES008,B,B,A,"Lack of appetite is a common symptom to encounter in patients with illness due to many reasons- infection, malignancy, heart failure, COPD or frailty. It may be a consequence of fatigue and nausea, low mood, pain and constipation, particularly in palliative patients, and is often a component of a 'failure to thrive' syndrome. Parents may often express concern about a child's loss of appetite, or food aversions. Polyphagia may be the consequence of behavioural changes, hormonal changes, psychiatric diagnoses and underlying genetic conditions. Appetite can often be affected by medication, and may be discussed as part of a  review of mental health diagnoses, contraception or Diabetes. Think about how you will assess for underlying causes, including potential emergencies such as Diabetic Ketoacidosis, and the physical impact of the altered appetite, considering which patients may need assessing by dieticians or the eating disorder service. In particular, speak to the clinical team about management of appetite changes in palliative patients and the frail elderly, and find out what services are available locally to support patients with an increase or decrease in their appetite.","Recognition of nutritional problems is extremely important as they are usually associated with bad prognosis. It is relatively uncommon for people to present to A&E, acute medical units or outpatient clinics with only this symptom, and it is usually associated with an acute illness or with other symptoms such as weight loss, extreme fatigue, mental health problems. People with advanced serious life-threatening illnesses, such as cancer, frequently experience appetite and weight loss.  Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, has the highest mortality rate among mental health of all psychiatric diseases and patients can experience severe hypoglycaemia and electrolyte disturbances leading to cardiac arrhythmias. In older people, loss of appetite can lead to malnutrition, sarcopenia, and frailty and can reveal other related issues such as: change in taste, swallowing problems, constipation, alcohol consumption, depression.

"Altered sensation, numbness and tingling",PRES009,B,A,A,"Abnormal sensory symptoms are a common reason for consultation in primary care, and may be the main reason for an appointment, part of a constellation of symptoms, or picked up during screening (for instance in a Diabetic annual review). Understanding the importance of the history and neurological examination in localising the lesion is key as this will guide further investigations and management. Speak to your GP tutors about common presentations of sensory disturbance in primary care, such as Herpes Zoster, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Hyperventilation, Diabetes, or spinal cord lesions and discuss how you might identify patients presenting with acute conditions like Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Which patients would you request investigations in, such as blood tests & nerve conduction studies, and who would you refer for imaging or assessment in secondary care?","People with sensory symptoms are often seen in neurology clinics (where generally their main concern is whether it is Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or a peripheral neuropathy) but you may also commonly encounter them in diabetes clinics (where peripheral neuropathies are particularly common). Acute presentations of central (MS) or peripheral (GBS) demyelination are occasionally seen in A&E, acute medical units and on neurology wards, or sometimes on stroke wards. Don’t forget about the cervical spine when assessing such patients. Sensory symptoms are also commonly part of functional neurological disorders. Think about how you can differentiate peripheral causes of sensory symptoms from central ones. Who needs further investigation, and how would you approach this?","Sensory neuropathy may not be a common presentation in paediatrics, but can have significant underlying causes if present. Take a thorough history and examine the area involved. Medication or drug related sensory neuropathy usually presents in a glove and stocking distribution and should be obvious from a good drug history. Neuropathic causes of altered sensation may be related to spinal impingement or injury and other signs of spinal cord compression (SCC) should be assessed such as urinary/bowel signs. SCC is rare in paediatrics but constitutes an emergency, and should be assessed urgently with imaging, preferably MRI but CT if MRI is not available. Sensory neuropathy of the head and neck region may be related to cranial nerve impairment and should also be considered for relatively urgent imaging.","severel diagnoses are important and treatable: vtiamin deficiences, (B12, folate); diabetes; alcohol history; carpal tunnel; paraneoplastic syndromes, MSK problems.

However, where the GP is concerned about serious underlying pathology they will be referred to secondary care. You will see patients with possible inflammatory spinal pain (spondyloarthritis) in rheumatology outpatient clinics (both new and follow-up patients). Some patients with unresponsive or severe mechanical back pain may also be seen in orthopaedic or neurosurgery clinics when surgery is being considered as an option. Patients with possible metastatic disease (usually presenting with red flag symptoms such as progressively worsening symptoms, night pain and systemic symptoms) may be seen during your oncology placements, on the general wards as well as in medical/surgical outpatient services (remember the common tumours that metastasize are breast, bronchus, kidney, thyroid and prostate). Any specialist seeing patients with problems in those areas will listen out for back pain in the patient story. Acute severe back pain may be seen in A&E or AAU, particularly if patients have additional neurological symptoms/signs and definitely if they have symptoms suggestive a cauda equina compression (which is a medical emergency). They will then get referred to either orthopaedics or neurosurgery for urgent surgery. When acute back pain is due to vertebral fracture (often thoracic spinal pain) the patient may then be seen in a metabolic bone clinic for further assessment and treatment. Vertebral fracture is something that is most commonly seen following falls in the elderly so may be seen on your geriatric experiences or in a geriatric clinic.",Back pain is not a common presenting symptom in childhood and adolescence. Children and adolescents with back pain will mostly present to primary care. Often trauma or benign musculoskeletal disorders are the cause of back pain in children but rare conditions that are more serious need to be considered. Think about what red flags you may find in the history and physical examination. ,massive spectrum outlined in secondary care. Be aware of other specific geriatric presentations: prolonged immoblity (trolley in ED); examine by undressing- review sacrum for pressures sores and moisture lesions; consider pressure relieving equipment.

Bed wetting,PRES011,C,A,A,"Usually raised by a parents, sometimes in isolation, or in relation to behavioural or other physical symptoms, bedwetting is often discussed with GPs or Health Visitors. Think about the questions you might ask in order to establish  the extent of the problem, and other relevant symptoms such as bowel problems, sleep disordered breathing and daytime incontinence. Identify the common causes of enuresis and the  disorders that it may be associated with. Be aware of the impact on quality of life and self-esteem, and speak to the clinical team about advice and resources that they may signpost parents to, as well as the treatment options (including conservative, alarm training and medical therapy).  Enuresis in adults is less common and always abnormal. Think about how you would address this in a consultation given the psychological impact and embarrassment patients will often feel, and the relevant risk factors that you would need to explore. Discuss with your tutor how you might manage an adult with this symptom, and in particular what you would consider as 'red-flags'. ","Bedwetting or nocturnal enuresis is a relatively common medical complaint with 6-10% of school-aged children reporting this problem. After the GP identifies whether the child is suffering from primary nocturnal enuresis (child that has never been consistently dry at night) or secondary nocturnal enuresis (child who has previously been dry for at least six months), they need to identify if the enuresis is ‘mono-symptomatic’ which means that the child has symptoms only at night or ‘non mono-symptomatic’ which means that the child has day time wetting symptoms as well as night time bedwetting. The GP will refer to secondary care the children showing primary bedwetting without daytime symptoms that have not responded to courses of initial treatments (such as enuresis alarm in combination with positive reward systems). Managing primary bedwetting with daytime symptoms involves secondary care investigations and assessment. In secondary care you will encounter primary enuresis with daytime symptoms and secondary enuresis in paediatric clinics. Enuresis can be the primary reason for presentation, but it can be part of a spectrum of other medical complaints. Paediatricians need to identify whether there are any sleep problems (such as obstructive sleep apnoea), any bladder problems (such as an overactive bladder), psychological stress, hormonal problems antidiuretic hormone-ADH) or whether genetics or other medical conditions are contributing to enuresis (especially in secondary enuresis, conditions like bladder infections, constipation, and diabetes).","Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem in young children with about 10% of children not being dry by night at the age of 7 years. In most children it will resolve spontaneously over time but some children require further evaluation, especially those with daytime incontinence and children with secondary enuresis who start to wet the bed after a period of being dry. Please consider constipation as a possible cause in your history taking and evaluation. Simple tips such as staying hydrated throughout the day but limiting fluid intake before bed can help children and their families. Have a look at enuresis clinic offerings in the community and their resources.", ,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,1,GP,,,Child health
Behaviour/personality change,PRES012,B,A,A,"The continuity provided by primary care makes it possible for clinicians to identify changes in their patients, or carers/family members may contact the surgery, with or without the knowledge of the affected individual. 75% of patients with dementia may experience behavioural and psychological symptoms varying from agitation to depression, apathy to disinhibition. In them, as with all patients, it is important to assess for physical problems (such as infection, pain or constipation), environmental factors and iatrogenic causes related to medication (e.g. anticholinergics) or substance abuse. Think about what would prompt a referral to teams such as mental health, memory clinic, acute geriatric assessment (e.g. RADAR) and neurology, and what tools the community team have to manage patients. Speak to the teams at nursing/residential homes linked to the surgery about how they approach patients with behaviour changes and the role of non-pharmacological management and medications such as hypnotics and antipsychotics. Think about how to support carers and family members in your patient population, and the role of the social prescriber and charity sector in reducing vulnerability of patients and their families. Communication across the primary care team is key, especially when patient's behaviour towards staff is challenging.","Personality disorder is when an individual has traits that are persistently inflexible and maladaptive, are stable over time, appeared in adolescence or early adulthood and that cause significant personal distress or functional impairment to the person or those around them. You are unlikely to diagnose a personality disorder in the secondary care setting in a hospital. The diagnosis of personality disorders is one that will generally be made by a psychiatrist over a series of appointments. The pattern of behaviour and experiences are enduring and according to the DSM-V criteria for diagnosis manifest in two (or more) of the following areas: Cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning, and impulse control. If the person already has a personality disorder, what one do they have? Cluster A are group of disorders characterised by odd or eccentric behaviours. Cluster B are those characterised by dramatic, emotional, or erratic behaviours. Cluster C are characterised by anxious or fearful behaviours. You might encounter a patient with a Cluster B Borderline Personality disorder in ED where they present with self-harm. The important thing is to recognise from their history that they might have a previous diagnosis of personality disorder; and, if there are concerns, to appropriately escalate to a psychiatrist - particularly if the patient self-harms. It is important to look out for red flags, and do not just put these ‘down’ to the personality disorder. Equally, a patient with a personality disorder presenting with another medical issue should be treated the same; and it is important not to bias your judgement against the patient. Can you think of any other ways you might encounter personality disorders in the secondary care setting?",See 'Behavioural difficulties in childhood',think delirium; collaterol history is essential.

Behavioural difficulties in childhood,PRES013,C,B,B,"Parents may present to discuss children's behavioural difficulties as a result of their own concerns, and also on the advice of teachers, health visitors or school nurses. Problems may be identified during a consultation with a parent about their own health when they are asked about home life and stressors. Sometimes acknowledgment of the impact, support and the offer of follow up may be all that is required. Speak to GPs about the local referral pathways for help with diagnoses such as ADHD and oppositional defiance disorder, any tools used, and their thoughts on assessing children for behavioural problems. Whilst GPs are well placed to use an holistic approach and their tools of continuity and knowledge of the child's family in an assessment, they often lack the time and formal knowledge required to assess a child for behavioural disorders.  Don't forget that sometimes what appears to be a problem with behaviour may be as a result of an undiagnosed medical issue such as sleep apnoea, thyroid disease or hearing/visual impairment. Be aware of the gap that often exists for adolescents between child and adult services.","All young children can be naughty, defiant and impulsive from time to time, which is perfectly normal. However, some children have extremely difficult and challenging behaviours that are outside the norm for their age. These behaviours maybe due to temporary stresses in their life or they might represent more enduring disorders.
Transient behavioural problems, which are present in only one setting (e.g in school and not at home or vice-versa), are more likely to be normal behaviour but if it becomes persistent and present in multiple settings, it may be indicative of a more serious problem.
The most common disruptive behaviour disorders include oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  These three behavioural disorders share some common symptoms, so diagnosis can be difficult and time consuming. A child or adolescent may have two disorders at the same time.
Other exacerbating factors can include emotional problems, mood disorders, family difficulties, substance abuse, learning difficulties, environmental problems, chronic diseases, bullying and peer pressure.
Boys are more likely than girls to suffer from behavioural disorders.
These children may present in any setting in Paediatrics- emergency paediatrics, Paediatric assessment unit, clinics or on the ward. Each contact is an opportunity to identify them and make a difference.
Untreated children with behavioural disorders may grow up to be dysfunctional adults. Generally, the earlier the intervention, the better the outcome is likely to be.
Treatment options include parent management training, cognitive behaviour therapy, medication and treatment for associated problems.", , ,"(PH2) Inequalities - Children,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Maternal & Child Health: Neurodevelopment problems in children and young people,Year 5 seminar: Abnormal Neurodevelopment,""Handbook of clinical psychopharmacology

Bites and stings,PRES014,A,A,A,"Whilst in the UK, the majority of bites and stings are common and minor, the management within primary care isn't always clear. Think about how you might distinguish between common insect bites, and what prompts patients to contact primary care. What are the concerning features that might prompt treatment or further investigation? How does your practice go about providing self-care advice to their population? In the case of animal and human bites, think about who you would offer antibiotics to, and which cases you would discuss with microbiology or refer to A&E. Be aware of the importance of considering safeguarding in some cases. In other countries where rabies or tetanus are a concern, or where bites and stings from snakes, marine fish and invertebrates are common, familiarise yourself with local guidance and advice regarding prevention and immediate management.","Bites are generally accidental injuries that cause itching and swelling, usually clearing up within one day. You will see these acutely in the Emergency Department where an infection is suspected or if they cause symptoms such as severe swelling, breathing difficulty, confusion, anxiety or agitation. ","Children can be exposed to bites and stings from the environment as they are often active and outdoors, especially younger children, but the majority of these will be minor. The cause of the bite or sting may not always be clear at presentation, unless an obvious history is available outlining witnessed exposure, which should form part of the history taking. Differential diagnosis includes urticaria and exposure to other pathogens. Management might be influenced by the pathogen, for instance tick bites need removal, but in the case of unclear pathogen, general management will include local/topical treatment and/or systemic anti-histamines/steroids. In the event of significant bites such as venomous insects/reptiles, which is rare, specialist advice should be sought immediately.

Blackouts/faints,PRES015,A,A,A,"Blackouts and faints are a common occurrence within the setting of a GP surgery due to the population attending, and may also occur following procedures e.g. vasovagal reactions following venepuncture or cervical shock post IUS/IUD insertion. Be aware of the emergency procedures within the primary care setting and speak to your tutor about management of minor injuries, including wounds that require suturing or dressing. Blackouts and faints may be the primary reason for consultation, or occur alongside other symptoms such as chest pain or headaches. Consider the red flags you would want to identify in different populations including children and the elderly. Who would you send to A&E in order to investigate the underlying cause or exclude trauma such as a subdural bleed or fracture? Which, if any features, would mean that you were happy to reassure a patient in a remote consultation? Think about what aspects of the episode would help you delineate blackouts from seizures, and practice taking collateral histories. Review ECGs with your GP tutor and consider what underlying changes you may be searching for. Finally, be aware of the importance of considering a patient's safety to drive etc whilst a cause is being explored- you should be aware of the DVLA guidance. ","Blackouts and faints are a common reason for attendance at emergency departments, often by ambulance. The key is to take a good history, particularly about what happens before the blackout. The patient may not remember anything after that, so you need to make every effort to obtain a witness history (including reviewing the paramedic notes). The main things to think about are vasovagal faints (of which postural hypotension can be a cause), cardiac causes (eg. arrhythmias, valve disease), seizures, non-epileptic attacks (part of the functional neurological disorders spectrum) and hypoglycaemia. How would you differentiate these from the history? What features might you need to ask specifically about? Don’t forget that the ECG is an essential investigation.

If the history doesn't clear things up, there are usually first fit clinics in neurology that patients can be booked directly into. There are also syncope clinics typically run by cardiology. Admission may be required if an underlying cardiac issue is identified (or suspected) or if the patient has significant injuries, which may mean they are admitted to an orthopaedic ward. Patients with blackouts are also commonly encountered on the gastroenterology/hepatology wards as alcohol misuse is a common contributor to blackouts, including alcohol withdrawal seizures. 

Patients with blackouts may also be seen in outpatients, including first fit clinics, general neurology clinics (eg. epilepsy), cardiac clinics and syncope clinics as well as medicine for the elderly. When blackouts are recurrent and the cause remains unclear, videos of what happens can be really helpful.
 
It is not just physical conditions that may cause patients to faint. Anxiety is also something that can contribute to vasovagal episodes (for example, by hyperventilation). These patients may also be found in psychiatry outpatients. Alcohol dependent patients may also present with blackouts, and may be receiving help with secondary care services in the community, for example, psychological support or counselling.","Blackouts and fainting episodes can occur in children and young adults and the differential diagnosis is broad, including neurological, cardiovascular and hypoxia related causes. To narrow down the cause, ask about the red flags including other signs of seizure activity such as tonic clonic/absence episodes, check postural blood pressure and ask about past history of cardiac abnormalities such as structural cardiac anomalies and surgery in the past medical history. Common causes of blackouts and faints in children include breath-holding episodes and hypotension. A drug history would also be important in these presentations, especially recreational drugs in teenage/young adult patients. ","First, take a clear history: is this episode a true loss of consciousness? Is is an unexplained fall with possible LOC? Vasovagal syncope is very common in older people, but risk of cardiac syncope increases with age due to poor LV ejection fraction and IHD. Vasodepression is very common and often worsened by anti-hypertensives.

Bleeding/bruising,PRES016,A,A,A,"Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or due to obstetric/gynaecological causes is covered in other presentations, but be aware that patients may present acutely bleeding from any part of their body, and you should familiarise yourself with how this may be managed in the primary care setting. Be aware of the causes of bruising including trauma, iatrogenic following surgery or venepuncture, abuse, medication, malignancy and haematological disease and think about questions you might ask to assess for red flags. Speak to the safeguarding lead at the practice about assessment of children and adults with bruising that suggests abuse. Consider the patients that you would request blood tests in, and with what urgency.  Be aware of the risk of bleeding on medication such as anticoagulants, antiplatelets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and how you might assess this using tools such as ORBIT. Speak to the GPs about management of bleeding in palliative patients who have chosen to remain at home.","ED in general is also a good place to find bleeding patients, this will be the first port of call for any kind of traumatic injuries that come in, including car accidents, or even stabbings.
Haematology outpatients will have patients with bleeding disorders (Haemophilia and Von Willebrand disease). You will also find patients who may have presented with bruising due to malignancy – ie leukaemia. On haem wards or outpatient chemotherapy units, patients on chemotherapy may develop thrombocytopenia due to treatment, symptoms include bleeding and/or bruising easily. Please keep in mind these patients are at higher risk of infection so please be careful if going into these areas.
Surgical wards and theatres may have patients with haemorrhages with varying causes including aortic dissections, traumatic injuries, aneurysm or simply post op complications. Bruising is common following trauma, so they may be on orthopaedic wards especially the elderly following falls leading to a fracture. Urology is another place you may find patients who presented with bleeds, haematuria being a common presentation. Haematuria patients may be found with either nephrology (renal stones, polycystic kidney disease, renal cancers) or urology (bladder cancer, enlarged prostate). ENT on calls may include patients with epistaxis on the wards that difficult to manage with standard ward care may need ENT input.
Obstetrics and gynaecology wards/outpatients is another good place to see patients with bleeding symptoms - placental abruptions, gynaecological cancers or miscarriages.  Gastroenterology may have patients who presented with haematemesis, or impaired INR due liver cirrhosis (alcohol, hepatitis, or more rarely haemochromatosis and Wilson’s disease)","This is a common presentation in the paediatric population and can involve oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, epistaxis and abnormal vaginal bleeding, as well as skin bruising. The causes can range from infection, inflammation and bleeding disorders to non-accidental injury (NAI). Take into consideration the child’s age when asking questions as NAI can be related to developmental stage. Red flags include bruising over non-contact areas eg abdomen, back, upper arms, thighs; uncontrolled bleeding and a family or personal history. Carefully consider the need for blood tests and workup in a bleeding/bruising child, which may be determined by the duration, location and presence/absence of a corroborative history. Most causes of bleeding in children are transient, but do keep malignancy as a potential differential diagnosis on your list when taking the history and considering investigations.","Always check a drug history, if needs be, check with GP.

Breast symptoms,PRES017,B,A,A,"Given clinician and patient concerns about breast cancers, and how common breast symptoms, especially discomfort are, this is a presentation that is seen frequently within primary care. Review the guidance for 2WW and urgent referrals and consider what symptoms are of concern and in which population. Be aware of breast disease presenting in all genders. Whilst Breast pain accounts for 41% of referrals to breast clinics, a recent retrospective study found a cancer detection rate of only 0.8%, which is comparable to the incidence in asymptomatic patients. Think about what questions can distinguish between the common causes of breast pain. Ask your tutor about who they screen for breast symptoms in, approach to examination, the advice that they give to patients, and how they would provide follow up. How do they manage concerns about breast cancer? Be aware of breast symptoms affecting women post-natally- speak to the midwives, health visitors or clinicians about general advice for lactating women, and identify resources that are available to support new parents with common issues such as blocked ducts, painful nipples and mastitis.","Patients presenting with breast symptoms such as breast pain, rash, discharge or breast lumps usually (but not always) present in hospital in a clinic setting as opposed to acutely in the emergency department. Breast clinics are specialist clinics run by breast surgeons who mainly get referred patients with breast lumps. Within these clinics, patients get a clinical assessment which will determine whether they require a mammogram and fine needle biopsy to reach a diagnosis – this is termed the “Triple Assessment”. Patients who do require surgery are operated in an elective setting involving multidisciplinary teams which may include the breast team, plastics and oncology. Other symptoms such as breast pain, rash and discharge usually present themselves either in the ward for patients experiencing complications post-surgery, or on follow-up in clinic. These complications can include infection (of the skin, soft tissue, mammary glands/ducts, surgical site) or bleeding. Other more uncommon breast symptoms such as gynecomastia usually appear as a coincidental finding as part of a wider systemic issue as opposed to being the primary cause for presentation in hospital.

Breathlessness (and cyanosis),PRES018,A,A,A,"A common symptom that may be the primary cause for concern, or part of a number of symptoms, breathlessness can be very distressing for patients and may signal a clinical emergency. You may encounter patients who are breathless during an on call, in an asthma or heart failure review, during a palliative care visit or with the midwives. Remote consulting has provided challenges in assessment of patients with breathlessness, especially with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 cases. Speak to the clinical team about how they manage remote consultations, F2F appointments and home visits for patients with breathlessness. Consider what tools the primary care team have to assess patients, including basic observations, ECGs, spirometry and access to blood tests and imaging. Think about what red flags you should identify in a history or examination, and think about how you would manage patients with suspected PE, deterioration in asthma or heart failure. Ask them about their management of acute asthma and exacerbations of COPD or bronchiectasis. Where is the resuscitation trolley kept and what drugs are on there? Are any patients on home oxygen or nebulisers? What is the access to pulmonary rehabilitation like? You may also see patients with psychological conditions presenting with breathlessness- how do you go about excluding physical causes, and how might you manage these patients? Be aware of how to assess children and neonates for signs of respiratory distress- speak to the GP tutor about how they manage children with conditions like bronchiolitis, and what safety netting they provide parents with.","Breathlessness is a common presenting complaint to the hospital. It is particularly prevalent during the winter season. When breathlessness is severe and oxygen saturation drops in the blood, patients can also present with central or peripheral cyanosis. The causes of breathlessness are often respiratory, such as exacerbation of underlying illnesses (COPD / asthma / bronchiectasis / lung fibrosis), chest infection or lung cancer. However, cardiovascular diseases such as valvular defects or heart failure may also lead to shortness of breath. Other factors contributing to symptoms development including obesity, muscle dysfunction, anxiety or panic attacks. It is therefore important to take detailed histories and examine patients carefully to determine the best investigation and management for these patients. ","Acute respiratory distress is a common presentation in children and these children often present to the A&E. Main causes of respiratory distress are respiratory tract infections, asthma and foreign body aspiration. Respiratory distress in children must be promptly recognised and treated as they may decompensate quickly. Use the NICE traffic light system to think about amber and red flags of respiratory distress. Many respiratory disorders in children can be diagnosed based on history and examination alone, think about distinguishing features of the different presentations and how to assess these. Cyanotic neonates and infants often have a cardiac cause. Think about initial assessment and stabilisation of children presenting with cyanosis.","A common presentation in older patients both on the wards and in clinic. A full history is essential, to identify chronicity and any new acute element. Beware the interpretation of a d-dimer test, as although labs do not give age-related reference ranges,  D-dimer has been shown to increase with age which lowers the specificity and increases false postive tests. It is essential to correlate the presentation with the test (as with all patients). Heart failure is also an extremely common presentation in older adults. These patients require frequent follow-up and education on how to manage progressive symptoms. Mortality rates are high and it is important to refer to community teams to reduce unnecessary admissions.","05 Vascular liver disorders - video,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute presentations in primary care Year 4 Seminar,Asthma and COPD -

Burns,PRES019,B,B,A,"Most burns are minor and can be managed in primary care. Be aware of immediate management of thermal, electrical and chemical burns as patients may call or walk in. Consider what features of burns may necessitate referral to A&E and be aware what characteristics might indicate non accidental injury. Speak to practice nurses about options for cleaning and dressing minor burns and be aware of advice to minimise scarring and protect from sun exposure.","Burn injuries represent one of the most common causes of accidental injury and death worldwide. Burn mechanisms can include heat (flame, hot liquid etc), electricity, friction, chemical, and radiation (radiotherapy). It is a presentation that you will mainly see in the emergency department or a specialist burns unit. The cornerstone to burn injury management is following an ABCDE approach and assessing the severity of the injury. Burn severity is assessed in terms of the percentage of the total body surface area affected by the burn, and the depth. Minor to moderate burns may be managed in the emergency department or in outpatient clinic. However, severe burns usually require admission to intensive care/ specialist burns units. On first presentation, pay attention to acute management of burns which include airway management, fluid resuscitation and pain management. Secondary management on the ward will further include aspects such as wound management, chemoprophylaxis against infections, aggressive pain and anxiety management and monitoring patient catabolic response. On the ward, observe how fluid management is performed, what kind of dressings are used by the staff members and how pain and anxiety is managed.  ","Childhood burns are almost always accidental and commonly minor. A good history is important in excluding non-accidental injury or neglect, taken into consideration in an age/development appropriate way. The cause of the burn is taken together with the location as certain areas are considered ‘special’, as well as the extent of the burn, which can be calculated a percentage of body surface area. Topical and systemic management should be used in conjunction and consideration made to whether referral to a specialist burns unit is required.

Cardiorespiratory arrest,PRES020,A,A,A,"All the primary care team are trained in adult and paediatric BLS guidelines as per the Resus Council- studies suggest that there is no survival benefit in using ALS versus BLS in an out of hospital setting. Given the complex protocol involved in ALS, it is better to deliver high quality BLS than low-quality ALS. Speak to your tutor about their experiences of CPR in the community and how their team are prepared for arrests on site and during home visits. Be aware that patients who have survived a cardiorespiratory arrest may have lasting health problems as a consequence, including neurological and psychological, and that the primary care team are likely to be involved in supporting them. Speak to the GP about advance care planning in palliative care and ReSPECT (Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment) conversations. If appropriate, be part of these conversations. Where is this information recorded, and how is it made accessible to paramedics, the out of hours services and palliative care teams? How are hospital conversations about CPR status shared with primary care? Think as well about how we can support relatives and carers who have been involved in an arrest setting and the impact on the experience of bereavement. ","Cardiopulmonary arrest means cessation of the effective heart and lung function to maintain life. This situation is not uncommon to face in the emergency department and on the ward and is quite stressful for the patient, the medical team and the surrounding ward patients. The causes of cardiac arrest can be summarized as 4 Hs and 4Ts. The 4 Hs are hypothermia, hypokalaemia, hypovolaemia and hypoxaemia. The 4 Ts are Thrombosis (i.e. Pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction), Tension pneumothorax, Tamponade (i.e. cardiac tamponade) and Toxins. There are conditions that mimic cardiac arrest and should be excluded on the initial evaluation. These include seizures, syncope and falls.
Management of the cardiorespiratory arrest can be divided into four stages: initial evaluation and basic life support (BLS), advanced life support (ALS), post-resuscitation care and long-term management. In the initial evaluation, one should confirm the complete cessation of breathing movement and central pulse while opening the upper airways (using chin-lift) for 10 seconds. If confirmed, then you should shout for help (press the bedside buzzer) and start the BLS algorithm. Another colleague on the ward should start a cardiac arrest call by calling the switchboard on 2222 and asking for an adult/paediatric arrest call, quoting the site. It is important to rule out any upper airway obstruction with a foreign body in the initial assessment. The BLS algorithm includes high-quality chest compressions with a rate of 100-120/minute in the form of 30 compressions alternating with 2 ventilations from a well-fitted facemask with a ventilation bag. The upper airways should be maintained open with chin-lift and using an adjuvant oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway. Next, the resuscitation team will arrive and start the ALS algorithm, trying to better support the airway, breathing and circulation while looking for a reversible cause for the cardiac arrest. Post-resuscitation care starts with successful Restoration Of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC). It aims to complete the identification and management of the cause of the arrest. It usually involves sending a whole set of blood tests, a VBG, making an ECG to identify myocardial ischaemia, giving IV fluids and keeping the patient in a well-monitored area. Other scans can be useful according to the clinical situation, such as echocardiogram and CT pulmonary angiogram. The long-term management phase includes more detailed management of the underlying problem, such as coronary revascularization and insertion of an ICD.", ,"There  is a drive to discuss all resuscitation decisions with patients on admission to hospital by using the RESPECT form. It is worth listening to these discussions which are led by senior decision makers. Many patients welcome these discussions; in other patients who may not have thought about this before, it can be a useful step in starting to plan for advanced care and end of life planning.","Cardio Respiratory: Assessment and management of the deteriorating patient,Cardiovascular and Peripheral Vascular examinations,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Escalation and indications for higher level support,""Paediatrics - Fever, Sepsis & Infections"",Respiratory examinations,Revision notes in cardiovascular physiology,Week 6 - Intensive Care,Recommended Cardio-respiratory medicine texts,Year 5 Cardiology Toolbox",10,Emergency medicine,,Cardiorespiratory arrest,"Acute and emergency,Cardiovascular,Respiratory,Perioperative medicine and anaesthesia"
Change in bowel habit,PRES021,B,A,A,"New looser stools or diarrhoea, constipation, change in stool frequency or colour, or the presence of blood are a common cause for consults, or could appear alongside numerous other symptoms such as weight loss, palpitations, abdominal pain, or vomiting, or be identified as part of a medication review. Think about what questions you ask about bowel habit, and the associated symptoms, travel history, conditions or medication that may indicate an underlying cause. Speak to a clinician about which patients can be managed conservatively/remotely, and who should be seen. Be aware of the common diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, associated conditions, and which patients to consider an alternative diagnosis in first. Identify useful resources that patients can access for common issues such as gastroenteritis, dietary intolerances, or toddlers diarrhoea and constipation in children. Consider when further investigations such as bloods, stool samples including cultures, giardia testing, fecal calprotectin or a FIT are appropriate. Review the urgent and 2WW referral criteria for colorectal locally and think about how patients may present with emergencies such as bowel obstruction. Consider patients in whom changes in bowel habit may be common e.g. constipation in those on opiates, and what can be done to reduce these risks. ","Bowel habit varies from person to person and a change in bowel habit can mean very different things to different people. It is therefore important to clarify what the patient meant. For example, they may experience changes in consistency or shape of the stool (looser or harder), changes in frequency of the bowel opening, or changes in the content of the stool (colour, presence of mucous or blood etc.). Frequently, change in bowel habit does not require emergency admissions to secondary care. However, many patients will need investigations in the hospital in the form of blood tests, colonoscopy and or CT depending on their exact symptom. Examples of causes of change in bowel habit including coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis), diverticulosis and bowel cancer. A thorough history and examination will help guide your differential diagnosis.","A change in bowel habit can be physiological in for example the weaning infant or a sign of an underlying disease. Causes for a change in bowel habit include viral gastroenteritis, toddler’s diarrhoea, coeliac disease and less commonly IBD. Think about red flags for pathological causes of a change in bowel habit in children. What questions would you ask to assess whether a child has normal bowel function? Try to use the Bristol Stool Chart in your assessment.","Older people with a change in bowel habit are often referred to the colo-rectal clinic on a 2WW pathway. However, if malignancy has been excluded, then patients are frequently referred to a Geriatric Clinic if no clear diagnosis has been made. See constipation for further notes. Drugs are an important cause of change in bowel symptoms and a detailed drug history is essential. Think about deprescribing (STOPP/START criteria). It is also worth noting that older frail patients may be extremely reluctant to undergo endoscopy and it is important to talk through the risks of benefits of this test and agree a patient centred plan moving forwards.","01 Overview of liver disorders talks - slides,01 Overview of liver disorders talks - video,02 Acute liver disorders - slides,02 Acute liver disorders - video,03 Chronic liver disorders - slides,04 Biliary liver disorders - video,05 Vascular liver disorders - slides,Oncology case-based teaching 1 - Rectal cancer,CCM lecture 2 - Abdominal X-Ray,Change in bowel habit - Diarrhoea or Constipation,Change in bowel habit - Diarrhoea or Constipation,Change in bowel habit - Diarrhoea or Constipation,Common Presentations of Hepatology - Dr Fotios Sampaziotis,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Gastrointestinal examinations,Hepatology 'wiki' for clinical students      ,Hepatology 2 - biliary disorders (Will Gelson),Inflammatory Bowel Disease Companion notes to recorded lecture - Dunecan Massey,Inflammatory Bowel Disease Recorded Lecture - Dunecan Massey,Inherited Liver Disease webinar - Bill Griffiths,Intestinal Failure Companion notes to recorded lecture - Dunecan Massey,Intestinal Failure Recorded lecture - Dunecan Massey,Liver tumours webinar - Matt Hoare,Managing Hepatology Emergencies as an FY1 (Catriona Davidson),""Recorded teaching session - Diarrhoea, Constipation and IBS - Dr Catriona Davidson"",""Slide deck - IBS, Diarrhoea and Constipation"",""Slides, Liver Tumours - Matt Hoare"",Steatorrhoea and Malabsorption,Steatorrhoea and Malabsorption,Steatorrhoea and Malabsorption,Year 4 - Medicine & Surgery Course (interviews and tutorials),Oncology extension teaching resources",32,Surgery,,"Change in bowel habit,Constipation","Cancer,Gastrointestinal including liver,Surgery,General practice and primary healthcare,Child health,Medicine of older adult"
Change in stool colour,PRES022,A,A,A,"A common presentation for parents of new babies who are concerned about the often normal change in colour from black, to green, to yellow stools, it is important to be aware of conditions such as intussusception, leading to blood or 'currant jelly' in the stool and biliary atresia leading to pale clay coloured stools. Think about other symptoms that would be relevant, and how you would assess a baby or young person for underlying gastrointestinal causes. Adults may present with fresh blood mixed into their stool as their only symptom, or with black tar like stools that may suggest gastrointestinal bleeding. Be aware of the questions you would ask to assess an underlying cause, including ascertaining other symptoms such as a change in stool consistency, abdominal pain, vomiting blood, or weight loss. Be aware of the impact of dietary changes and medication, and possible impact of travel on infection risk. Speak to your tutor about interpreting tests available in primary care to assess patients, such as FIT, full blood count and liver function tests, and review the 2WW guidance for cancer diagnoses. Who would you 'watch and wait' and wo would you refer?","Faeces can come in a variety of colours which can indicate the underlying disease process. Patients may have change in stool colour as a concurrent symptom with their presenting symptom (for example abdominal pain) or may be the primary presenting symptom (more commonly with red stool). In addition, patients may develop a change in stool colour acutely whilst in the secondary care setting which may be iatrogenic or coincidental development of a different pathology. Consider the chronicity of the change and the other associated changes to bowel habits (for example frequency, stool consistency) and also constitutional symptoms such as fever. Some presentations may need more urgent investigation and management than others. For example, think about a patient who presents with intermittent upper abdominal pain after eating, pale loose stools that are difficult to flush but is otherwise systemically well versus the patient who presents with upper abdominal pain with black sticky stools and is light-headed. What are your differentials and initial investigations? How are you going to manage these patients differently?

Changes in speech/language,PRES023,B,A,A,"In Primary Care, patients may present with a change in speech (such as slurring, or difficulty word finding) as their primary concern, or alongside other symptoms such as weakness, tremor or cough. Distinguishing what is actually occurring- be that aphasia (the loss of an ability to produce or understand language), dysarthria (difficult or unclear articulation of speech) or dysphonia (a change in the quality of the voice) is key to managing the patient appropriately. How would you assess this in general practice and what examination would you perform? Consider the red flags that would prompt urgent referral. What are the pathways locally for suspected TIA/stroke? What would trigger a 2-week-wait referral or urgent imaging? In patients with a chronic speech disturbance e.g. following a stroke, consider the resources available in the community, and the role of the GP in ensuring equality of access to healthcare.","This is a broad topic that would include common conditions such as dementia and stroke as well as rarer problems such as motor neurone disease and myasthenia gravis. Thus such patients may present to neurology clinics, dementia services (often community based), care of the elderly clinics and acutely on stroke pathways. Determining the onset of the symptoms can be challenging when speech and language are affected, so collateral history is very important. Looking back in time to significant events such as Christmas and Easter can help to track onset. Consider how you would differentiate language problems from acute confusion and delirium, for which investigation and treatment would be very different. How is speech affected when the right (slurred) versus left (Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas in right-handed people) hand side of the brain is damaged?", ,"This presentation may be seen in IP and OP geriatrics, particularly with a more gradual change. Acute changes tend to be seen in the stroke services, but if symptoms have been slow to emerge, it tends to be referred later. Differentials to consider include SOL, MND, cerebrovascular disease (in the absence of an obvious acute event). It is important to assess swallow in patients with this presentation, as often a change in speech may be accompanied by a change in swallow which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia.","Coma,Coma,Coma,Confusion and Dementia,Confusion and Dementia,Confusion and Dementia,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Dementia & Delirium Year 4,Functional neuroanatomy - How to localise a lesion,Functional Neurological Disorders resources,Nervous System examinations,Neuroinflammation and Neurogenetics,Neuroinflammation and Neurogenetics,Neuroinflammation and Neurogenetics,Neurology is simple- how to avoid neurophobia seminar,Stroke,Stroke,Stroke,Stroke seminar,Weakness of Arms and Legs,Weakness of Arms and Legs,Weakness of Arms and Legs,Wed pm neurology seminar series: Cognitive Neurology,Year 4 Vascular teaching session,Year 5 seminar: Abnormal Neurodevelopment,Bibliography - books that may help learn about neurology",26,"Medicine,Neurology",,"Pressure of speech,Speech and language problems","Mental health,Child health,Neurosciences"
Chest pain,PRES024,A,A,A,"Speak to the primary care team about how patients who report chest pain are triaged within their practice. Whilst cardiac causes such as ACS are usually foremost in the mind of patients and health professionals, be aware of other serious causes such as PE, aortic dissection, pneumonia, and pneumothorax. Are patients told to call for an ambulance? Are they brought down to see the Duty Doctor, or do they have a phone call first? What happens to walk-ins? Is there capacity for an ECG and observations immediately in your practice? Be aware of the ACS protocol, and think about the management of a patient who presents pain free with their last episode of pain some days ago. Think about your physical assessment of a patient with chest pain. Be aware that the ""typical"" symptoms of ACS do not always apply to some groups of patients, including women, and diabetic patients. The new high sensitivity troponin test may become available in primary care soon- discuss the impact this may have with the team, and also their thoughts on D-dimers in primary care for possible PE. Have a look at the PERC (Pulmonary Embolism Rule out Criteria) and Wells to help you estimate risk of PE. Does your local hospital have an ambulatory care unit where they are able to assess patients when a GP is concerned about a PE in an otherwise stable patient? Is there a Rapid Access Chest Pain service? It is also important to be able to make a positive diagnosis of non-cardiac chest pain which can be reassuring for patients and reduce referral to hospital. Speak to your GP about the uncertainty sometimes present in these consultations and how time and safety netting are used as tools.","Chest pain is one of the most common complaints you might see when in A&E and on call, with a wide differential ranging from cardiovascular problems to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Proper history taking is key in differentiating sinister causes of chest pain from more benign causes, allowing for proper triaging and treatment of this very common problem.", ,"A common symptom in older patients for a wide variety of reasons. It is essential to differentiate between life threatening emergencies (eg such as ACS and aortic dissection) and other less acute pathologies. Remember that older people have multiple co-morbidities and  inpatients may also suffer acute chest pain, so it is not just seen in the ED or the resus room. Type 2 MIs (i.e. secondary ischaemia due to increased demand or reduced supply) are more common in older people due to co-existing conditions such as heart failure, CKD and AF.

Child abuse,PRES025,B,A,A,"Knowing how to recognise abuse and its risk factors, how to report and escalate concerns, and how to work with victims is a core skill for all members of the primary care team.  Understand the different forms of child abuse and how it might present. Think about how you would manage a case in which there was a concern for a child's safety. Speak to the practice's safeguarding lead about the process for referrals locally (www.safeguardingcambspeterborough.org.uk), which children would be directly referred to paediatricians, and how concerns are documented within the patient's notes. Be aware of the barriers to safeguarding and the potential impact of primary care teams often caring for all members of the same family. Discuss the statutory duties around sharing of information. You should also be aware that one in five adults aged 18 to 74 are estimated to have experienced at least one form of abuse by the age of 16, and that consultations addressing historic abuse and its far reaching health and social consequences are common in primary care. Identify agencies that patients may be signposted to, and consider the importance of continuity of care.","Child abuse cases are a frequent occurrence in the Children’s A&E as well as CAU, some come in through clinic referral, tip off from schools, and social support workers. Sometimes, the children come in for something completely different but with the help of well trained and experienced staff members, the cases are identified based on high index of suspicion. These cases can sometimes be very daunting, due to their complexities and having various team members involved. Sometimes, it takes a while to get to the bottom of it. I can assure you it gets easier once you have been involved in the management of one. It is good to understand the various forms of child abuse, how they present, salient points to look out for in history and during physical examinations and how to manage them. It is very helpful to attend safeguarding teaching to get a taster. ","Child abuse is one of the hardest aspects of Paediatrics to be faced with as a medical professional. It can be recognised in any setting where children are seen and includes both intentional harm (physical, sexual or emotional) and neglect. It is important to know common signs of child abuse and to recognise patterns that may be found on physical examination. Knowledge of safeguarding frameworks and procedures is necessary to ensure the right steps are being taken to protect the child from further harm. Please also look after yourself when confronted with a child abuse case and seek support from junior or senior staff involved with the case or your placement.

Child health surveillance,PRES026,A,A,A,GP surgeries are involved initially in child health surveillance as part of the six week check which you may be able to participate in during your time on placement- find out what is assessed during this visit and how findings are recorded and acted upon. Surgeries are also involved in the immunisation schedule until children start school and you may be involved with discussions with parents pre and post immunisations. Health Visitors and school nurses communicate directly with GPs if they have concerns about a child's health or welfare. Health visitors are often part of internal child safeguarding meetings and this is a valuable opportunity for discussion about a child's environment and circumstances.,"Child health surveillance begins from when a child is born, various screenings are done from birth which include NIPE (New-born and Infant physical examination), hearing screen, blood spot check, and subsequently immunization from 8 weeks of life. The one you are likely to be part of as students is the NIPE screening. This involves asking the parents and midwives if they have any concern at all with the new-born, following which screening questions are asked and then the examination is performed and documented with appropriate plan for follow up or otherwise. This usually occurs in the delivery and neonatal units of secondary care settings. Speak to the midwife or paediatric doctor in charge and inform them of your interest in having a NIPE done. Prior to this, it is helpful to review your notes on NIPE risk factors, as well as the examinations. Once you see someone do a NIPE, you then will be confident to do one yourself while being observed and can even go ahead to teach.

Confusion/brain fog,PRES027,B,A,A,"Delirium- or acute confusional state- has a higher prevalence in patients in patients over 85, and those over 65 in residential care. Think about how you might begin to quantify the degree of confusion and assess for precipitating factors. What questions will you ask the patient, carers or family? Be aware of common causes such as infection, constipation, low glucose or alcohol withdrawal and think about how you would assess a new case of confusion.  Speak to your tutor about which cases it may be appropriate to manage in primary care, and who should be admitted. Have you considered capacity? Review the NICE guidelines regarding the immediate management of children with an acute confusional state. Think about how you might begin to assess an adult with more progressive symptoms of mild confusion which may be linked with memory loss or other neurological or psychiatric symptoms, who presents for their first ten minute appointment in primary care. Delineate between confusion and what patients describe as brain fog, recognised in a variety of conditions such as menopause and CFS/ME.","Confusion is a very common feature in hospital inpatients, particularly the elderly, and may be encountered in almost any setting; it may be the main presenting complaint, or may accompany other problems such as sepsis. You may also encounter it in outpatient clinics, particularly memory clinic. It is important to establish your patient’s cognitive baseline (this may require a collateral history from family or carers) and determine the timecourse of their confusion. It is also important to quantify cognitive status as far as possible, to give a reproducible measure which can be used to track the evolution of your patient’s confusion; there are a range of scoring tools for this, from brief (4AT, AMTS) to more extended (MMSE, ACE-III, MoCA). Confusion may be broadly split into delirium (acute and associated with change in level of consciousness), dementia (chronic and without impairment of consciousness) and psychiatric causes; each of these has its own differential diagnosis and investigative pathway, and so the first step is to determine into which of these groups your patient falls. A confused patient may lack capacity to make decisions about their treatment (though this should never be assumed, and must be carefully assessed for each individual patient and decision), and it is important to be aware of the medicolegal framework for providing care to those who lack capacity.", ,"This is one of the Geriatric Giants and often, confusion may be the only presentation of physical illness. Establishing a cognitive baseline is essential and usually requires a collaterol history from a care giver. Confusion may be chronic, acute or acute on chronic. A delirium is an acute confusional state and patients with a dementia are more at risk of delirium.  The BGS 'silver book' quotes that ED healthcare providers miss delirium in 67% of cases. A delirium may be either hypoactive or hyperactive. It may be triggered by numerous aetiologies, but common triggers may be remembered by PINCH ME mneumonic which stands for pain, infection, nutrition, constipation, hydration, medication and environment.","Age UK,American Geriatrics Society,Article: Arlt W; Society for Endocrinology Clinical Committee.

Congenital Abnormalities,PRES028,C,B,B,"You may see congenital abnormalities at any age in primary care- whilst many anomalies are identified during pregnancy and at birth, GPs may see babies and children with undiagnosed anomalies such as congenital heart disease or neural tube defects at the six week check.  GPs are often consulted about common risk factors for congenital abnormalities including diabetes, medication such as anti-epileptics, and infections such as varicella and CMV. Look up the guidance and be aware of where to go for advice. Be aware that some people do not attend screening or healthcare settings during pregnancies (either due to choice or barriers to access) and every clinical encounter may therefore, be important opportunity to assess for congenital abnormalities. Speak to the GP about children and young people with diagnosed congenital abnormalities at the practice- what additional support is required for them and their families, if any? How, and by whom, are their care needs coordinated? What approaches are present in the practice to address the healthcare inequalities often experienced by individuals with disabilities?","Congenital abnormalities
Heart disease
Presentations of congenital heart disease may occur antenatally where imaging of the heart is included in the 18-20 week fetal anomaly scan. Alternatively, the presence of murmur or cyanosis during the routine newborn examination may be an indication. Signs of heart failure (respiratory distress, hepatomegaly, reduced feeding and diaphoresis) in newborns presenting via ED may also be indicative. Congenital heart disease can be considered in two groups: acyanotic vs cyanotic. The most common causes for each sub-group are outlined below:

Acyanotic:
• ventricular septal defects (VSD) - most common, account for 30%.
• atrial septal defect (ASD), more common in adult patients due to later presentation.
• patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
• coarctation of the aorta
• aortic valve stenosis

Cyanotic - most common causes
• tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), presentations usually appear at 1-2 months of age.
• transposition of the great arteries (TGA). TGA is the most common lesion at birth.
• tricuspid atresia.
• pulmonary valve stenosis (cyanosis is dependent on the severity and presence of accompanying defects).

Gastrointestinal visceral malformations.
• Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is defined by the herniation of abdominal organs into the mediastinum due to diaphragmatic deficiency (failed closure of the pleuroperitoneal canal). Resultant pulmonary hypoplasia and hypertension may cause respiratory distress post-natally. 85% of cases of CDH are diagnosed as left-sided posterolateral Bochadlex hernia. Survival rates are limited to 50% of newborns.
• Gastroschisis is defined as a congenital defect in the anterior abdominal wall. Post-delivery (ideally vaginal), newborns should be taken to theatre for surgical correction within 4 hours.
• Exomphalos is also known as omphalocoele. It is distinguished by the amniotic membrane and peritoneum covering of the abdominal contents leaving the anterior abdominal wall. Exomphalos is associated with Down’s syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and cardiac and kidney malformations. Delivery via Caesarean section is preferred to mitigate against the risk of sac rupture. Staged repair is attempted as increased intra-abdominal pressure may prevent primary closure.","Congenital abnormalities is an umbrella term that covers any abnormality that was present at birth. These anomalies can be caused by genetic abnormalities or environmental factors and in some case do not present until later in childhood or have adult onset. Children with congenital anomalies are commonly seen in secondary and tertiary care Paediatrics but can be seen in many other settings as well.  It is important to have knowledge of the signs and symptoms of common syndromes seen in paediatrics, such as Down or Turner syndrome, and to understand the underlying genetic anomaly.

Constipation,PRES029,B,A,A,"The most common gastrointestinal complaint for patients, constipation is seen and managed predominantly within primary care. Consider what people mean when they say ""constipation"" and what you need to know. Whilst it may be a symptom and complication of metabolic conditions, such as hypothyroidism or hypercalcaemia, neurological diagnoses such as Parkinson's Disease or due to obstructive intestinal conditions, more often it is related to medication or idiopathic in nature. You may therefore, discuss constipation as part of a medication or chronic disease review, baby checks, or as one of a collection of symptoms raised during a consultation.
Consider important red flags, who should have further investigations, and who should be referred to secondary care and when.
Speak to your GP tutor about management of constipation within primary care, and the balance between offering lifestyle and dietary advice (and how this is provided) and medication. Have a look at the guidelines for management of constipation in adults and children, and speak to the clinical team about management of constipation in frail and palliative patients.","Constipation is a common symptom in secondary care. It is frequently found in inpatients on any ward. General contributing factors include reduced mobility, reduced appetite and an unfamiliar environment. On surgical placements, you may see patients with constipation caused by opiate analgesia, or cases of postoperative ileus following abdominal surgery. On medical wards, specific causes for constipation include drugs like iron supplements, or diseases like diabetes. In A&E, you may encounter constipation as a symptom of underlying bowel obstruction. In outpatient clinics, constipation is a symptom of numerous diseases ranging from neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis, to endocrine diseases like hypothyroidism. Learning the different causes and management for constipation will help you to confidently manage this very common symptom as a practicing clinician in the future.  ",Constipation is very common in children and is commonly a functional disorder. What questions would you ask to assess whether a child has constipation? Try to use the Bristol Stool Chart in your assessment. Soiling is often seen in constipated children. Think about common triggers. What advice we can give parents to help prevent constipation in their child? Which signs and symptoms may help you recognise an organic cause for constipation? ,"see change in bowel habit. Constipation is very common in older patients who have longer inpatient stays, as a result of immobility and a change in normal diet and fluid status. It is a common cause of delirium. Beware the patient who reports new diarrhoea as impaction due to chronic constipation with overflow diarrhoea is frequently seen. Daily bowel charts are highly recommended in older inpatients. The Bristol Stool Chart can be very helpful and can be shown to carers, to prevent future episodes of constipation.","""Article: Koulouri O, Gurnell M. How to interpret thyroid function tests.

Contraception request/advice,PRES030,B,A,A,"Whilst patients can increasingly access contraception from pharmacies or use family planning clinics, the majority of contraception care is provided by primary care. Spending time with nurses or GPs with an interest in contraception, and reviewing the practice’s proformas and FSRH guidance should provide you with a good understanding of the options available to patients. However, discussions around contraception are relevant to many interactions with patients- postnatally, during chronic disease reviews for epilepsy, diabetes and migraine, and when seeing patients with conditions such as acne, endometriosis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and menopause. If the practice you are based at provides long acting reversible contraception (LARC) such as the IUS/IUD and implant, you may wish to discuss observing a clinic. Speak to the nurses and your tutor about provision of contraception to young patients and the safeguarding involved, and consider the impact of health inequalities on access to contraception for groups such as LGBTQ+, learning disabled and asylum seekers. Have an understanding of how the different methods work, including fertility awareness and lactational amenorrhoea, and why some methods may not appeal to some individuals. Be aware of the information needed about patients in order to prescribe safely, and resources that you can signpost patients to regarding their options and treatment. Speak to your GP tutor about how requests for emergency contraception are managed by the on-call team. ","Permanent methods of contraception delivered via female and male sterilisation (vasectomy), or insertion of intrauterine systems (IUS) / hormonal coil and intrauterine devices (IUD) may be offered in a secondary care setting. The mode of action of IUDs includes prevention of fertilisation by reducing sperm motility and survival. Efficacy is immediate following insertion, lasting reliably for 5 years and up to 10 years if copper based. Alternatively, IUS prevents endometrial proliferation and causes cervical mucous thickening. IUS efficacy becomes reliant after 7 days and remains for 5 years.

Patients may also present to gynaecology clinics with adverse effects from contraception. This includes uterine perforation which may be seen in up to 2 / 1000 insertions and notably in breastfeeding women. The proportional risk of ectopic pregnancy is also increased, although the absolute number compared to cohorts not using contraception is lower. A small increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease up to 20 days post insertion is also noted. The risk of expulsion of contraceptive devices is 1 in 20 and of most pertinence in the first 3 months.",Contraception advice is provided by primary care., ,"CEL11: Duties of Care & Candour,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Maternal & Child Health: Contraception,Practical Prescribing Year 4 Seminar,Reproductive Health in Primary Care,Year 4 Core Clinical Method - Introduction to Gynaecology,Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare",7,GP,,Contraception request/advice,"Obstetrics and gynaecology,General practice and primary healthcare"
Cough,PRES031,A,A,A,"It is unlikely that you will experience 3 years of GP placements without seeing a patient with a cough. Identify the other important symptoms and red flags when assessing a patient with a cough, and consider what impact they will have on your choices. Face to face or remote- what are the current Covid-19 protocols? Who should have imaging and what other investigations may be appropriate? What are the important red flags to exclude, and what questions will you ask to identify simple, common diagnoses such as asthma, GORD, upper airway cough syndrome and infection? Consider chronicity, timing, presence of wheeze or sputum, smoking history, local rates of TB and medications. For children, be aware of respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis, croup and pertussis and how to differentiate between them. Speak to your tutor about the stepwise approach required in a patient with chronic cough and no clear diagnosis.","Cough is a common symptom which may be acute or chronic in a given patient. Cough features commonly as part of a patient’s acute presenting complaint to A&E, often in association with other respiratory symptoms. It may signify a diagnosis of pneumonia, including Covid, an exacerbation of COPD, a pulmonary embolism, or any of numerous other acute causes. Many hospital inpatients also have a chronic cough due to underlying respiratory or cardiovascular disease. Common causes include COPD, heart failure, and gastrointestinal reflux disease. Inpatients may also develop a cough as a side effect of drugs they have been started on, an example being ACE inhibitors. On specialist inpatient units and clinics, you may encounter patients with rarer causes of cough. Examples include cases of interstitial lung disease in a respiratory clinic, or pulmonary tuberculosis on an infectious diseases placement. Learning about the differential diagnosis of cough will enable you to more confidently manage this common symptom in the future. ","It is normal for young children to have up to 8 or more colds per year. As you can image, cough is a very common presentation in children in primary and secondary care. Sometimes the cough alone can be diagnostic, such as the barking cough in croup. Try to listen to as many of these as you can during your placements. Cough may also be the presenting symptom of allergy and asthma. What would you look out for in your history and examination to diagnose these? What investigations may be helpful? ","As well as respiratory causes of cough, ACE inhibitors may cause a cough, even if the patient has been on this drug for a while. Reflux is another cause which should not be forgotten in older people. Subacute aspiriation due to deteriorating swallow may also present with chronic cough.","05 Vascular liver disorders - video,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute presentations in primary care Year 4 Seminar,Assessment of a child under 5 with fever in primary care,Asthma and COPD - Dr Marianne Phillips - 16th April 2020,Breathlessness and Cyanosis,Breathlessness and Cyanosis,Breathlessness and Cyanosis,Bristol Medical School respiratory exam video,British Thoracic Society Guideline for Bronchiectasis in Adults,British Thoracic Society Guidelines for the Management of Community Acquired Pneumonia in Adults: update 2009,British Thoracic Society/SIGN British Guideline on the Management of Asthma,Bronchiectasis and lung cancer - Dr Parth Patel - 1/6/20 ,Cambridge University Health Partners field overview video - Pulmonary embolism - James Garvey,Cancer Biology and Systemic Therapies teaching session,Cardiovascular and Peripheral Vascular examinations,Oncology case-based teaching 3 - Lung case,Oncology case-based teaching 4 - Oncology emergency,Oncology case-based teaching 6 - Superior venacava obstruction,CCM lecture 1 - Chest X-Ray,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Emphysema - Dr Thomas Pulimood and Dr Nicola Newman,European Society of Cardiology 2019 Guidelines on Acute Pulmonary Embolism (Diagnosis and Management of),Fever in a traveller from the tropics,Haemoptysis,Haemoptysis,Haemoptysis,Interstitial Lung Disease and Bronchiectasis - Dr Catriona Davidson,Lymphadenopathy,Lymphadenopathy,Lymphadenopathy,Maternal & Child Health: Common Childhood Encounters in Primary Care,NICE Guideline - Lung cancer: diagnosis and management,NICE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in over 16s: diagnosis and management,""NICE: Smoking: acute, maternity and mental health services"",NICE: Tuberculosis,Oncological Imaging in the Era of Precision Medicine lecture,Peadiatrics - Respiratory,Pleural effusion,Pleural effusion,Pleural effusion,Pleural Effusion basics video by Osmosis Youtube channel,Pleural Effusion cases and answers on the University of Washington site,Pleural Effusions - Dr Thomas Pulimood and Dr Nicola Newman,Pneumothorax and Pneumonia - Dr Marianne Phillips - 23rd April 2020 (Year 5),""Pneumothorax, Pneumonia, and Pulmonary Embolism - Dr Marianne Phillips (Year 4)"",Practical Prescribing in primary care,Practical Skills in Primary Care 4b GP tutorial,Pulmonary Pathology Index - The Internet Pathology Laboratory  for Medical Education,Radiology Masterclass website - Chest X-ray Abnormalities,Radiology Tutor website,Radiopaedia website - cases and imaging,RCEM Learning page on Community Acquired Pneumonia,Resp.net resources page,Respiratory examinations,Respiratory drugs,Respiratory section of AnaesthesiaUK,Sepsis and Pneumonia - Dr Marianne Phillips - 30th April 2020,Slides - Bronchiectasis and Lung Cancer,Slides - Interstitial Lung Disease and Bronchiectasis,""Slides - Pneumothorax, Pneumonia and Pulmonary Embolism"",Specialist Medicine: Early Detection of Cancer,Spirometry site - understanding this lung fuction test,University of Washington Images in Pathology,Year 4 - Initiating the Medical Interview,Year 5 seminar: Respiratory Technique,Tuberculosis,Recommended Cardio-respiratory medicine texts,Chest x-ray,eBook for Undergraduate Education in Radiology (ESR),www.learningradiology.com,Radiology Assistant,Radiology Cafe,Radiology Masterclass,Radiopaedia,Radiology Masters,3D printing and Radiology",79,Medicine,,Cough,"Cancer,Cardiovascular,Child health,""Ear, nose and throat"",Respiratory,General practice and primary healthcare"
Crying baby,PRES032,B,A,A,"A common reason for parents to make contact with general practice and the health visitor team, the skill is in the ability to exclude significant illness and provide reassurance. Consider what relevant information you need about both the child and their family and environmental factors. Ask about timing and duration of crying episodes and consider red flags including features of infection, projectile vomiting, bloody stool and poor weight gain. Be aware of the definition of infantile colic, how it differs from normal crying, and the evidence based management. Importantly be aware of the links between infantile colic and increased risk of postpartum depression and early cessation of breastfeeding. One anonymous community based sample found that 2-4% of parents reported having smothers, slapped or shaken their baby at least once because of crying (Reijneveld et al, 2004). Speak to the child safeguarding lead at the practice about how to identify children at risk of harm, abuse or neglect and identify the local support available to parents and carers.",The crying baby is a common presentation in both primary and secondary care and is often very distressing for the parents. Crying is normal in infants younger than 3 months of age and is often diagnosed as colic. It is important to differentiate colic from other conditions that may cause prolonged crying or irritability in infants through a thorough history and examination. Think about what red flags may encounter. It is important to address the effects of the crying infant on the parents as this has been associated with postpartum depression and risk of abuse.,MOVED TO SECONDARY, ,"Assessment of a child under 5 with fever in primary care,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Paediatrics - Child protection,Year 5 seminar: Introduction to Neonatology",4,GP,,Crying baby,"Child health,General practice and primary healthcare"
"Death, dying and bereavement",PRES033,B,B,A,"Around 1% of the population dies each year. Many of these deaths are predictable, such as those due to progressive deterioration from frailty, organ failure or malignancy. GPs are responsible for the medical care of the more than 27% of patients who die in their own homes and the 23% who die in care homes. Proactive advance care planning prevents many such patients from dying ‘badly’ in ambulances or on emergency department trolleys. Many GP surgeries use the Gold Standards Framework register to co-ordinate the MDT care of patients approaching the end of their lives. 
Questions to consider:
What features in the history would make you suspect that a patient is in the last few weeks or months of their lives? What can a GP do to improve the likelihood of a patient dying in their preferred place with good symptom control? Bereavement care is also an important part of general practice. How can GPs effectively support patients who have been recently bereaved?","Some outpatient clinics (including oncology, neurology, and cardiology) are well positioned to highlight a patient’s end of life care needs to their GP, for example when they are too frail to attend or have no further active treatment options available. In addition, around a third of patients admitted to hospital as an emergency are in the last year of their lives. It is perhaps therefore no surprise that nearly a half of all adult deaths still occur in the acute hospital setting. As a Foundation Doctor you will look after many patients who are in the final days; the average is around 40 in your first year of practise alone. With the support of consultant colleagues, you will have a crucial role in ensuring that they die with as much dignity and comfort as possible.  This is a huge responsibility, so be sure to make the most of every opportunity to learn from observing hospital and hospice doctors discussing with relatives, performing clinical assessments, and prescribing for this patient group.
Questions to consider:
What features at the bedside would make you suspect that a patient is imminently dying? Following senior review, which anticipatory medications should you consider prescribing for such patients? When should you involve the hospital Specialist Palliative Care Team?", ,"In the ideal, death in the older population should be anticipated and planned for and having early and honest conversations is helpful, particularly when prognosis is uncertain. If dying is not recognised, then harm may result from the provision of burdensome and undignified investigations and treatment, and loss of time to accept death and say goodbye. Death is part of the day job for a Geriatrician, and helping patients plan for their own death, as well cope with the death of a spouse is essential.

Deliberate self harm,PRES034,B,A,A,"Deliberate self harm may be seen in primary care acutely, when assessing and treating self-inflicted wounds, or may only be identified when a patient is directly asked. Scars may be apparent on examination, and though not always directly relevant to the consultation, it is important for patients to feel able to talk about them in a non-judgemental environment. A symptom of underlying distress which may be related to many factors, DSH may not be suicidal in intent, however, there is a strong correlation and thus it is clearly something that it is important to discuss during mental health discussions, and something that is of concern for the healthcare team. Practice asking relevant questions about DSH and suicide with your tutor or the CCS team. Think about risk reduction such as careful prescribing and speak to the practice nurses about wound management and the provision of a 'rescue pack' where appropriate. Have a look online for available support such as MIND Self Harm and Self Injury Support. Speak to the team about crisis management locally and the current pressures in particular on Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). DSH is prevalent in children and young people with mental health problems, and increasing, and GPs may be contacted by parents or school teams- understand the guidance regarding confidentiality.","Patients with deliberate self harm (DSH) – intentional injury without conscious suicidal intent – can present via the Police to a place of safety in a psychiatric unit for psychiatric assessment, usually following medical clearance in the Emergency Department, if the damage is deemed severe enough for tissue injury to occur. Therefore, you may encounter these patients on your inpatient Psychiatry or Emergency Department placements, and they may present to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service) outpatient clinics, as DSH is particularly prevalent in this age group. Less commonly, you may see patients presenting with DSH in the context of known mental health problems following complicated surgery on the acute surgical ward, or following prolonged hospital admission for a medical reason on the acute medical unit. You may be asked to see these patients during your liaison psychiatry block to take a history and perform a mini mental state examination.","Teenagers and young adults can present with deliberate self harm (DSH) in the paediatric setting, and DSH is not always suicidal in intent, though the correlation can be high. DSH can present as physical harm such as scars or drug abuse (prescription, over the counter or recreational). A good direct and corroborative history from family, school and friends is important and early consideration for referral to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), maintaining confidentiality as appropriate. An understanding of the mental health act and the allowances around significant risk and assessment of capacity is helpful when assessing whether a child or young person is acting in their own best interest.","Depression is the most common mental health problem in later life, and has an important with physical ill-health and social isolation. Self-harm in older people is much less common than at a younger age. However, older people who self-harm have high levels of suicidal intent. About 15% of older people with a first episode of self-harm go on to repeat the act, and there is a 49-fold increase in risk of suicide.

Diarrhoea,PRES035,B,A,A,"Diarrhoea is perhaps one of the most common symptoms to be discussed in primary care. Patients may report this as the only symptom, or diarrhoea may be discussed in relation to other symptoms such as abdominal pain, anxiety or during a medication review. In the acute phase, patients may contact wanting advice about hydration, time away from educational settings or work, the role of antibiotics, or whether to stop medications such as diuretics. Who do you feel comfortable managing over the phone? Who should be seen, and when? Be aware of the advice regarding hydration and hygiene for possible infective causes and review the NICE guidelines regarding the patients to consider stool cultures in- and what these should look for (including giardia, cryptosporidium and Clostridium difficile.)  When should you notify public health teams? Not all diarrhoea is infective, and 4-5% of cases become chronic. You will need to consider diagnoses such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease, IBS, Coeliac disease, thyroid disease and malignancy, and should explore the investigation options available in primary care such as FIT, Faecal Calprotectin and blood tests. Review the local 2WW colorectal referral guidelines. Think about practical management for patients who are bed bound or less mobile.","Diarrhoea is the passage of three or more loose stools a day which can be acute or chronic. Diarrhoea is most commonly due to infection but can be due to many other causes including anxiety, medication side effects, autoimmune and inflammatory pathology. You are likely to encounter diarrhoea in all the inpatient settings, including the emergency department, medical wards, and surgical wards. You may also encounter this in clinic, particularly for patients that have chronic diarrhoea that is undergoing investigation or that is known to be secondary to an inflammatory disease such as inflammatory bowel disease. When encountering diarrhoea, it is important that you consider both the cause and complications (such as dehydration and electrolyte disturbance) in your assessment. You will want to know the onset, duration, frequency, severity, and any red flags. The diagnosis may be made clinically, from a detailed history and examination, or may need more extensive investigations (which could include stool cultures, inflammatory markers, and imaging). Consider the impact of diarrhoea on the patient’s secondary care journey, and the wider implications that an undifferentiated diarrhoeal illness may have on patient isolation and infection control management. ","Most episodes of diarrhoea in children will be due to acute viral gastroenteritis, which is a common presentation in children in primary and secondary care. Severe diarrhoea can lead to dehydration in young children. When you see a child with diarrhoea, try to think about how you would assess their volume status and how you would identify children at risk of dehydration. Other causes of diarrhoea in children include bacterial enteritis, intussusception, appendicitis and inflammatory bowel disease. What red flags would help you distinguish those disorders from a viral gastroenteritis? A common innocent cause of diarrhoea in young children is toddler’s diarrhoea, what advice could you give parents in these cases? ","Older people with a change in bowel habit are often referred to the colo-rectal clinic on a 2WW pathway. However, if malignancy has been excluded, then patients are frequently referred to a Geriatric Clinic if no clear diagnosis has been made. See constipation for further notes. Drugs are an important cause of change in bowel symptoms and a detailed drug history is essential. Think about deprescribing (STOPP/START criteria).

Diplopia,PRES036,B,B,A,"Patients present to their opticians or GPs if diplopia is the only symptom but you may elicit diplopia in a patient with symptoms such as headache or neck swelling. Practice assessment of the eye movement. Ask if the problem resolves when the patient closes one eye- if it doesn't, the issue is monocular and should be referred to ophthalmology- or if it fluctuates throughout the day, which may be due to myasthenia. Painful ophthalmoplegia, stemming from trauma, vascular causes, infection or malignancy, is important to identify quickly and refer immediately to secondary care. Speak to your tutor about local pathways for patients with visual symptoms including eye casualty, and access to imaging.","Patients with diplopia may present in secondary care to ophthalmology or other related specialties such as neurology or paediatrics. The key to diagnosis is a careful assessment of ocular movements and searching for associated signs. Binocular diplopia may result from neurogenic, myogenic or orbital conditions. Patients will occasionally present with monocular diplopia (or ghosting of vision) due to corneal opacities or cataract.","Diplopia usually presents as incoordination or squinting, especially in younger children. Patients can be referred by opticians as part of routine screening. Common underlying causes in paediatrics include strabismus, leading to abnormal eye movements. It is important to consider neurological causes of diplopia in children such as cranial nerve palsies, which can indicate a serious underlying cause such as a space occupying lesion in the midbrain/brainstem.

Dizziness/vertigo,PRES037,B,A,A,"Dizziness is a common complaint in primary care, and is used as an umbrella term by patients to describe many different sensations including an illusion of movement, a sense of near faint, unsteadiness/sense of imbalance and ‘giddiness’. Given the breadth of possible underlying diagnoses, think about what information you will need from the patient. What questions could you ask to clarify what they mean? Think about how the history will inform the examination. What features would prompt an urgent referral to cardiology, neurology or ENT, and what investigations might be helpful within primary care? Which management options are you aware of for the common causes of these symptoms?","Dizziness is a presentation typically encountered in neurology, cardiology and ENT clinics. Posterior circulation strokes and MS would be typical neurological causes, with acoustic neuromas somewhat rarer, but benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and labyrinthitis would be far more common causes and relate to the ear. Postural hypotension and cardiac arrythmias can also present with dizziness. Due to the association with falls, you may also see this in the emergency department, acute medical unit and care of the elderly wards, and when presenting acutely, on the stroke wards. Once again, history is the key – what does the patient mean by dizziness, how did it start, are there any other associated symptoms and signs? How can you distinguish between dizziness due to pathology in the ear versus the brain? What investigations may help make a diagnosis, or rule out worrying possibilities? What interventions may help the patient regain their independence?","As dizziness is a subjective symptom, it is usually only prevalent in older children who can articulate this sensation. It may present as nystagmus and unsteady gait in younger children. Causes can be peripheral, affecting the vestibular system or central, CNS related. Frequently associated with infection in the paediatric population, other rarer causes such as structural abnormalities and neoplasms should be considered in the differential diagnosis. There may be associated signs such as rash, fever indicating infection e.g. in Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. ","Chronic dizziness is commonly  referred to Geriatric Medicine. Up to 38% of older adults complain of dizziness in some series. It is often multifactorial and very difficult to manage. Taking a good history can be really challenging, partly due to the lack of vocabulary in the English language to describe this symptom. Try to define whether dizziness means vertigo (rotational), muzzy-headed, lightheaded, pre-syncopal, a feeling a being drunk etc. Chronic cerebrovascular small vessel disease is likely to contribute to chronic dizziness and is very hard to manage. Look for reversible causes such as BPPV (do a Hallpike's test); review medications; look for postural hypotension. Being honest with a patient that there are no reversible causes is important. Betahistine and cinnarizine should only be used for short term management of acute rotational vertigo and patients should not be left on these drugs long-term.","Article: Arlt W; Society for Endocrinology Clinical Committee.

Mood elevation is not a very common new presentation amongst acute hospital inpatients, but is striking and often difficult to manage in that setting (for example, if an active and disinhibited patient is in the same environment as vulnerable others). Amongst pharmacological triggers, “unopposed” antidepressants in people with bipolar affective disorder, and high-dose steroids in anyone, are well known.

However, it could be encountered in the medical outpatient clinics as a complication of other medical conditions or currently administered treatment.
During your urology posting, you will get to know the several physical or psychological causes of ED. Differentiating between these 2 major categories will assist with your assessment and management of the patients.
ED has been notably identified as a common side effects of several medications, including but not limited to thiazide diuretics, betablockers, antidepressants, antipsychotic, antiandrogen etc. Taking a good medication history will make a real difference to the overall assessment of the patient.
ED could develop due to excessive cycling of more than 3 hours in a week or could be due to more limiting conditions affecting the central nervous system (eg Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, stroke and spinal compression).
Injuries or surgical procedures to the pelvis and lower back could interrupt blood or nerve supply responsible for achieving an erection. Taking a good past medical and surgical history would reveal this as a possible cause.
Underlying endocrine disorders such as Cushing’s disease, prolactinoma, metabolic syndrome, Hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, diabetes etc could be the cause of ED in a good proportion of patients, making it a common presentation to the endocrine clinic.
Atherosclerosis, a significant risk factor for ED could be seen in patients with diabetes, hypertension, smokers, obesity, and hypercholesterolaemia. Lifestyle modification and management of the above conditions could be all that is required to reverse erectile dysfunction.
Psychological problems such as being in a new relationship, previous traumatic sexual experience or relationship problems could lead to variation in erectile dysfunction such that patient could be able to achieve erection during sleep due to unawareness but not during sexual activities. Significant level of stress, anxiety and depression are all mental health conditions associated with ED. Unfortunately, medications available for these conditions also carry a similar side effect.
People with ED will often feel embarrassed to speak about it, as such, adequate reassurance is essential to ensure a smooth and effective history taking, as treatment is often directed at the underlying causative factors.",No Paeds entry,See sexual dysfunction,"Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Genitourinary Medicine in the Community",2,GP,,Erectile dysfunction,"Cardiovascular,Endocrine and metabolic,Renal and urology,General practice and primary healthcare,Sexual health"
Excessive thirst,PRES045,B,A,A,"Often presenting alongside other symptoms such as polyuria, it is important to be able to identify patients, especially children and young people or the elderly with increased thirst and polydipsia related to hyperglycaemia, hypercalcaemia or hypovolaemia as this may be an emergency. Be aware that a change in environment leading to reduced access to fluid (children in education settings, adults in care) may be a factor. Many medications and conditions can lead to a sensation of a dry mouth that may lead to an increase in drinking behaviour, without a physiological cause. Be aware of the risk of hyponatraemia due to excess intake of water and how to further investigate and manage this.","Excessive thirst, also known as polydipsia, is a common presentation to the endocrine clinic. However, it would rarely occur without other associated symptoms.
Excessive thirst would usually result from excess fluid loss and this is physiological in pregnancy, hot weather and post work out. It could also result from excess caffeine or alcohol intake. However, you will come to realise that this seemingly simple symptom could be a manifestation of chronic conditions that could be fatal if not diagnosed early.
Endocrine conditions like Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetes Insipidus, DKA and Hypercalcaemia are possible underlying causes of excessive thirst.
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common presentation to the Acute medical unit/ED and the presence of other associated symptoms with investigation findings will aid prompt diagnosis and treatment.
Diabetes insipidus occur due to the inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine leading to excessive fluid loss in cases of lithium intake, hypercalcaemia, hypokalaemia and use of desmopressin. Diabetes insipidus could also result as a complication of a head injury, following pituitary surgery or due to the presence of a pituitary tumour.
Hypercalcaemia could be due to an underlying lung malignancy or sarcoidosis -which will both be seen in the respiratory clinic.
The use of Lithium is common in the treatment of bipolar disorder, and excessive thirst as a side effect could be a presentation to the psychiatry clinic alongside psychogenic polydipsia in patients suffering from Schizophrenia.

How will you manage their expectations?","The onset of facial pain may be slow and insidious, or sudden onset and severe, and the nature of the symptoms will often impact where patients present. Patients with facial pain are likely to present either to their dental surgery, or to A&E and acute medical units, depending on the perceived origin of their symptoms. In hospital, they may then be seen by the neurology or rheumatology teams, with input from ophthalmology if there are associated visual symptoms. It is important to consider however that some patients presenting to A&E may have a dental cause for their symptoms, and need to be referred back to their dentist.
Facial pain is a relatively rare presentation, with the commonest non-dental facial pain caused by temporomandibular disorders. Trigeminal neuralgia causes severe, electric shock like pain, causing patients to present acutely.

Some conditions that cause facial swelling are as follows 1. Erysipelas 2. Dental abscess 3. Periorbital cellulitis/ Preseptal cellulitis 4. Orbital cellulitis 5. Angioedema 6. Allergic reaction
Preseptal cellulitis also known as periorbital cellulitis presents with eye pain, and redness. There is generally involvement of one eye characterized by periorbital swelling. Chemosis which is conjunctival swelling is seen in severe cases only. A history of recent sinusitis, prolonged or worsening upper respiratory symptoms, insect bite, or local face or eyelid trauma is supportive of the diagnosis of preseptal cellulitis. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the common pathogens related to sinusitis. Staphylococcus aureus (including [MRSA]) and Streptococcus pyogenes are the common pathogens related to infection of the skin and skin structures.
In secondary care it is imperative to distinguish this condition from orbital cellulitis which is a medical emergency and requires inpatient treatment.
Clinical signs that should raise concern for orbital cellulitis include ophthalmoplegia with diplopia, pain with eye movement, visual impairment, and proptosis. This is because orbital cellulitis causes inflammation of the extraocular muscles and fatty tissues within the orbit, but preseptal cellulitis does not. Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the orbits and sinuses can be used to distinguish preseptal cellulitis from orbital cellulitis.
The patient with no signs of systemic toxicity can be treated in clinics. However, it will be prudent that a close follow-up is ensured. Hospitalization is recommended for any of the following and such patients should be managed as cases of orbital cellulitis until it is excluded.
•Children aged less than one year
•Children who cannot be fully examined due to them being uncooperative
•Patients who are systemically unwell
•Patients with equivocal clinical or radiographic findings suggesting that the orbit   is involved
•Patients who have not improved despite outpatient therapy in 24 to 48 hours
Antibiotic choice is made based on clinical features of infections. For example, if there is absence or presence of skin trauma in the periorbital region or the infection has succeeded a period of sinusitis. The local trust antibiotic guidelines and ophthalmology consultation will be useful in deciding most appropriate antibiotic therapy.","The underlying pathology for facial/periorbital swelling in children can be localised or systemic. Again, infection such as periorbital cellulitis can present in this way, as well as generalised oedema due to renal or cardiac causes, the former being more common in children. To narrow the differential diagnosis, consider a history of recent infection, urinary dysfunction and a history of cardiac abnormalities. Glomerulonephritis is a common cause of generalised oedema in children, followed by other renal/cardiac pathology. Superior vena caval obstruction should remain in the differential diagnosis and can be excluded by a careful and thorough examination.

Faecal incontinence,PRES049,B,B,A,"Despite the significant impact on quality of life, some people will be reluctant to report faecal incontinence, and it may only be identified when asked about specifically, or mentioned by carers or family. The aetiology is usually multifactorial, due to dysfunction of the sphincters, decreased sensation, altered stool consistency, abnormal rectal compliance. Children commonly present with overflow as part of constipation, as to older patients with neurological disease, immobility, poor fluid intake or constipating medications. It is important to ask about during medication reviews, in patients with neurological disease including spinal cord injuries, and diabetes, and in people who have undergone anorectal surgery, irradiation and vaginal deliveries, for instance, during the 6-week check. Consider what questions you would ask, and specifically what red flags would prompt urgent referral to A&E for imaging or a 2 week wait. Discuss with your tutor what physical exam is required, and when appropriate, undertake rectal examination with their supervision. Review the guidelines for management of impaction, especially in children, and think about how patients and carers can be supported practically with these distressing symptoms, including with pads & skin care advice, and input from dieticians and support groups. Be aware of the role of medication, and the specialist continence services.","Faecal incontinence is often a multifactorial condition, and this means patients in a variety of settings may list it as one of their presenting symptoms. It most commonly affects the elderly, but may also be a feature in younger patients with inflammatory bowel disease, or with neurological conditions. Those presenting acutely with faecal incontinence are likely to be seen initially in A&E and then transferred to the relevant medical team. This may be care of the elderly, neurology or gastroenterology.
There is significant social stigma attached to faecal incontinence, and thus a sensitive line of history taking is essential. It is also important to ascertain if it has been sudden onset, as this may indicate spinal cord pathology and warrant prompt escalation to senior, and the neurology team. More common causes include overflow incontinence due to constipation, and sphincter dysfunction after obstetric delivery, or recent surgery of the rectum.
It is also important to note that for some patients in the hospital, faecal incontinence is not part of their presenting complaint and simply part of their baseline. Elderly patients may lose continence as part of the aging process, or younger patients with complex needs may lose continence as a symptom of a more complex neurological or developmental condition. With these patients it is most important to address consequences of the incontinence, such as increased risk of pressure sores, skin breakage and infection.", ,"Faecal incontinence is commonly seen in older people who have chronic constipation. This leads to impaction and then overflow. In addition, faecal incontinence may occur due to overuse of laxatives; delirium, or due to immobility problems where the older person is only incontinent as they physically can not reach a toilet quickly enough. A detailed history of bowel habit, house layout, cognition, medication, diet etc is essential.","Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Gastrointestinal examinations",2,Surgery,,Faecal incontinence,"Gastrointestinal including liver,Medicine of older adult"
Falls,PRES050,A,A,A,"Atul Gawande states that 'The single most serious threat older people face is falling'. Patients themselves may not initially admit to falls, but it is an important thing to identify as the potential impact on independence and health is significant.  Routinely ask older people and their carers if they have fallen, and consider what factors are likely to be predictive of further falls. Be aware of the importance of assessing for trauma following a fall, and how patients are referred for imaging where necessary. Speak to the GP about the specialist falls service locally, and what other support is available to patients identified as being at risk. Practice assessments such as the Timed up and Go test, and assessing for physical signs such as postural hypotension or parkinsonism. Speak to clinical pharmacists about deprescribing in patients at risk.","The elderly patients presenting to a secondary care facility with falls related injuries often require admission and sometimes prolonged hospital stay. Their management requires a multi-disciplinary approach consisting of ortho-geriatricians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists etc.
The cause for falls is often multifactorial. The environmental factors working jointly with age-related physiological causes increase falls risk. Some recognized risk factors include past history of a fall, limb weakness, age, cognitive decline, impaired balance, psychotropic drug use, arthritis, history of stroke, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and anemia.
Polypharmacy due to a large number of prescribed medications, which increase vulnerability to falls, can be addressed in secondary care through a thorough assessment of patients’ medical needs. It can be avoided in primary care by the GPs by ensuring periodic medical assessment of these patients.
These patients should be asked at least once yearly about falls. Further evaluation is indicated for those who present with a fall or have a history of recurrent falls. In secondary care their evaluation is best done by Rapid Assessment Frailty Team (RAFT) which in turn is supported by Geriatric team, a subspeciality in Internal Medicine.
Evaluation for those who have sustained a fall include postural vital signs, assessment of visual acuity, hearing, and muscle function. A neurological examination will help to establish their baseline functional status. Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) in secondary care is a useful tool in deciding treatment and ceiling of care plans. Diagnostic tests include a complete blood count (CBC), urea and electrolytes, glucose level, and vitamin D. Holter monitoring, echocardiograms, and radiologic studies are indicated by findings on history of exam. Assessment of carotid sinus sensitivity may be indicated in people with unexplained multiple falls.
The disposition plan for these patients need a robust planning including coordinated plans between hospital-based services and community services to ensure that further falls are prevented and the patients’ independence in their daily activities is maintained as far as possible. Simultaneously it is ensured that they go back into a safe environment when discharged from secondary care.", ,"Falls related deaths account for up to 40% of all injury-deaths worldwide. Falls account for 17% of all ED attendances in older people. Falls should be simplified into explainable episodes (trips, poor pavement, shoes etc) or unexplainable falls. The later must be treated as Syncope. Then a full multi-disciplinary assessment of the aetiology and often, multiple factors that increase the risk of falling must be undertaken. This should lead to a management plan designed to reduce future falls and to consider treatment of bone health (think Vitamin D, DEXA scans, FRAX score, bisphosphonates).","Age UK,American Geriatrics Society,BGS Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Toolkit for Primary Care Practitioners ,Book: Nicholl CG and Wilson KJ.

Faltering growth,PRES051,C,B,B,"Slower weight gain than is expected may be picked up at a 6 week check, identified by a health visitor and referred to the GP, or picked up when a child is being assessed for something else such as infection, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Be aware of 'normal' weight loss within the first few days of life, and consider how you might assess a baby that is failing to gain weight. Be aware of community support such as Health Visitors, Midwives and Breastfeeding clinics. Review the 'red book' centile charts provided for parents to record growth, and how weight is tracked on the primary care system. Consider how to identify feeding issues in older children, and how you might manage these initially. Who would you refer to paediatrics, or investigate for underlying conditions such as coeliac disease?","The term faltering growth (failure to thrive) refers to poor weight gain in children and has a wide differential diagnosis. It is a common presentation in primary care and a common reason for referral to secondary care. Weight is plotted on a growth chart to adjust for sex and age in childhood and medical students are expected to be able to accurately plot and interpret growth charts. Faltering growth can have biological, psychosocial and environmental factors which need to be fully explored in a full history and examination. Linear growth also needs to be taken into consideration. Think about what are red flags regarding weight in the first days of life and when to refer children younger than 2 years of age and those over 2 years. Finally, faltering linear growth and short stature are a separate clinical presentation in childhood with its own differential diagnosis you should think about.",(ORIGINAL PAEDS ONE ACTUALLY SECONDARY ENTRY), ,"(PH2) Inequalities - Children,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Failure to thrive,Failure to Thrive - ELearning,Failure to Thrive - ELearning,Failure to Thrive - ELearning,Immuno-deficiency 1,Immuno-deficiency 1,Immuno-deficiency 1,Immuno-deficiency 2,Immuno-deficiency 2,Immuno-deficiency 2,Paediatrics - Puberty & Growth,Year 5 seminar: Murmurs and congenital heart disease",14,Child health,,,Child health
Fasciculation,PRES052,C,A,A,"Fasciculation may commonly be noticed in healthy people, often in their calves, hands, and around the eyes and nose, and it is not uncommon for patients to present to a GP concerned about something underlying such as Motor Neurone Disease. They may also be encountered when examining a patient for another reason such as speech disturbance or weakness. Consider how you might distinguish between benign fasciculation’s and underlying more serious pathology? Which patients would you investigate further, and who would you reassure?","Fasciculations (muscle twitching) are a relatively uncommon symptom, and most of the time if this is the presentation, it will be in the context of benign cramp fasciculation syndrome. When fasciculations represent structural damage, it is damage to lower motor neurones and the patient’s main concern is usually whether they have Motor Neurone Disease (MND). Anything that affects lower motor neurones can cause fasciculations, such as degenerative spinal disease if it affects the nerve roots. If motor neurones are affected, then you would also expect weakness. So, history and examination are key once again. You are relatively unlikely to encounter fasciculations – neurology clinics and specifically the MND clinic are the most likely place to see this in secondary care.

Fatigue,PRES053,B,B,A,"A symptom of physical & psychological disorders, or a combination of the two, fatigue or ‘tired all the time’ is an extremely common presentation in General Practice- there are estimates that at any one time, 6-7%  of the population experience fatigue. Patients may report a difficulty in initiating activity, reduced endurance, or difficulty with concentration, memory and emotional stability. Ideas about physical, psychological and social causes should be incorporated into the consultation and investigation- consider the patients you have seen on placement and the approaches and tools that primary care clinicians take. Does every patient presenting with fatigue merit bloods tests? And which investigations would you request? Consider what components of the history – onset/pattern/associated symptoms/sleep patterns/medication- might prompt you to investigate for an organic cause, and think about red flags. How might you approach management of patients who have no apparent physical cause- what tools can you offer them? Think about how you might manage children with fatigue, and patients with possible Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ME or long-COVID","Fatigue is a common symptoms for multiple medical problems and so you will see patients presenting with fatigue in many outpatient and inpatient settings (particularly in medicine). Infectious diseases often cause fatigue and so you will often see patients, where there is a concern about an infectious cause of fatigue, during your infectious diseases block. Anaemia, endocrine disorders (particularly thyroid disease, diabetes and Addison's disease), malignancy (particularly haematological malignancies), chronic cardiorespiratory problems, renal failure and hepatic disorders are all common medical causes of fatigue. You will encounter these patients during medical placements (particularly in outpatient clinics). Underlying autoimmune disease (SLE, Sjogren's syndrome, PMR, rheumatoid arthritis etc) can all cause persistent fatigue and so will be seen in rheumatology clinics. Mental health problems can also cause fatigue and so you may see patients with fatigue, associated with psychiatric problems, during your psychiatry attachments. Sleep problems (see under sleep problems) can present with chronic fatigue. Patients with otherwise unexplained chronic fatigue (chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia) may be referred to neurology (chronic fatigue syndrome) or to rheumatology clinics (fibromyalgia)","Fatigue can be one of the presenting symptoms of many medical and mental health conditions in childhood. These children will often be referred following initial screening by their GP for a comprehensive review by a paediatrician. Common medical causes of fatigue in children includes anaemia, asthma, hypothyroidism, infection (EBV). There are specialised clinics for myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome.

Fever,PRES054,A,A,A,"Whilst fever is often the primary reason for contact especially by parents and carers of children and young people, it is an important symptom to identify when patients present for other reasons such as breathlessness, headache, skin rash or confusion. Speak to the practice about their approach to triaging patients with fever, particularly during the pandemic. What support do community pharmacists provide? How do you assess a patient with fever, especially when the cause is not immediately apparent- think about how to establish travel history, sexual history, and symptoms that might suggest systemic rheumatic disease. Be aware that the ability to develop fever in older adults is impaired. What is the role of investigations such as urine dipstick and bloods? Understand what red flags may indicate sepsis or malignancy, and tools such as the NICE Traffic Light System to help you approach management. Familiarise yourself with general supportive advice for febrile patients, and practice safety netting using resources such as https://what0-18.nhs.uk.","Fever (or pyrexia) is among the most common symptoms you will encounter in inpatient secondary care settings and it may occur at any point during an admission. In outpatient settings, you may encounter fever as a symptom of chronic conditions more often than acute medical issues. The patient may complain of hot flushes and sweating, or, conversely, shivering and chills. It is usually a sign of infection, but may also result from drug reactions, drug withdrawals, malignancies, thyrotoxic crisis, and some types of vasculitis, such as Kawasaki syndrome—so remember to consider differential diagnoses. What clinical signs and investigations might help you identify the likely cause? Infective fever may occur in any inpatient group so you are likely to come across it in all your hospital placements. A common and serious cause is sepsis, which often presents with other telltale signs (e.g. hypotension, tachycardia, and/or increased respiratory rate) and requires urgent investigations and treatment. When you are covering the wards and holding a bleep, expect the possibility of nurses calling about a patient with fever and a high NEWS score—this requires urgent A to E assessment of the patient and, if you suspect infection, the sepsis 6 protocol. What would guide your decision on which antibiotic to choose? What are the possible explanations for an infection failing to respond to antibiotics? ",Fever is one of the most common reasons for parents to present with their child to primary or secondary care. Whilst it is often a symptom of simple viral infections in children it is crucial to recognised the child with sepsis or other invasive infections that require urgent care. What red flags do you know? You need to be aware that in young children (<6 months of age) the temperature alone is red flag and sepsis treatment is advised. Think about the NICE traffic light system when assessing a child with fever. ,"Older adults commonly have lower core body temperature and altered thermoregulatory responses. In short, this is due to age-related physiological changes, but is also compounded by the presence of  comorbidities. This means that in an individual, single-point measurements of vital signs have less sensitivity in detecting disease processes. For example, in one series of older adults with pneumonia, only 50% of patients mounted a fever. Thus, it is important to treat older patients as individuals and follow the trend of their individual vital signs rather than relying on population norms. Fever in older patients is neither sensitive nor specific for infection. Although a fever of >38 degrees increases the probability of bacterial infection in older adults, there are many other causes of PUO. Equally, the absence of a fever in an older adult does NOT rule out infection. As always with older people, a comprehensive assessment is required examing all systems.","04 Biliary liver disorders - video,05 Vascular liver disorders - slides,05 Vascular liver disorders - video,Alcoholic hepatitis webinar - Matt Hoare,Approach to Sepsis in Adults presenting in Primary Care,Arthritis,Arthritis,Arthritis,Assessment of a child under 5 with fever in primary care,British Thoracic Society Guidelines for the Management of Community Acquired Pneumonia in Adults: update 2009,Cambridge University Health Partners field overview video - Sepsis and the ‘Sepsis Six’ - Sarah Cowan,Cardiovascular and Peripheral Vascular examinations,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Dr Hoda Alkoky - Approach to Monoarthritis,Fever in a traveller from the tropics,Gastrointestinal examinations,Haemoptysis,Haemoptysis,Haemoptysis,Headache and facial pain,Headache and facial pain,Headache and facial pain,HIV,HIV,HIV,HIV infection,""Infection cases & quiz (diarrhoea, discitis, meningitis)"",Maternal & Child Health: Common Childhood Encounters in Primary Care,Module 4 - Acute oncology and approach to the unwell cancer patient,MSK infection - Osteomyelitis,MSK Infection - Periprosthetic Joint Infection,MSK Infection - Septic Arthritis,NICE: Tuberculosis,""Paediatrics - Fever, Sepsis & Infections"",Pneumothorax and Pneumonia - Dr Marianne Phillips - 23rd April 2020 (Year 5),""Pneumothorax, Pneumonia, and Pulmonary Embolism - Dr Marianne Phillips (Year 4)"",Pyrexia of undetermined origin,Pyrexia of undetermined origin,Pyrexia of undetermined origin,RCEM Learning page on Community Acquired Pneumonia,Respiratory examinations,Sepsis and Pneumonia - Dr Marianne Phillips - 30th April 2020,Shock,Shock,Shock,""Slides - Pneumothorax, Pneumonia and Pulmonary Embolism"",""Slides, Alcoholic Hepatitis - Matt Hoare"",Weakness of Arms and Legs,Weakness of Arms and Legs,Weakness of Arms and Legs,Year 5 seminar: Fever and Sepsis,Tuberculosis,Antibiotics & Antibiotics Stewardship",53,Medicine,,Fever,"Cardiovascular,Child health,Clinical haematology,Infection,Musculoskeletal,Respiratory,General practice and primary healthcare"
Fits/Seizures,PRES055,B,A,A,"GPs are responsible for managing the long term health needs of the roughly 600,000 people in the UK with confirmed epilepsy- during your time in primary care you may be involved in the annual review that takes into account seizures, medication, driving, contraception & pregnancy. They are also often the first port of call for patients, and their relatives, who have experienced an event that may have been a fit or a seizure. Consider what is important when taking a history from a patient who has had a possible seizure and what resources you might use to better identify what had occurred. What would prompt a referral to a “First Fit” clinic, and what would you advise a patient in the meantime about safety precautions, first aid & driving?

Food intolerance,PRES057,B,B,A,"Difficulty digesting or metabolizing certain food groups is reported by 15-20% of the population, and includes conditions such as lactose or fructose intolerance. Though not allergies, patients or parents of children may not appreciate the distinction and will commonly seek further testing and advice from primary care. Clinical presentations are often gastrointestinal symptoms such as increased gas, bloating, pain and diarrhoea. Think about how you might approach a patient reporting these symptoms- what would you want to exclude and who would you want to investigate further? In particular be aware of what might trigger a referral in a child. Be aware of tests that may be promoted to people to help them identify food intolerance (e.g. hair analysis) and the reasons why these are not offered in primary care. Speak to the GP about what support, including dietary advice can be offered to patients.","You will most certainly encounter patients with food intolerance on everyday basis in the hospital- on every ward above the bed there will be a sign with what the patient is intolerant to. Think outside of the box and every time a patient tells you they have allergy ask them what actually happens so that you can distinguish allergy from food intolerance. What other settings will you think about it? Where will it be most crucial? Remember that many drugs contain egg yolk etc. What questions will you ask the patient? What other conditions might mimic food intolerance? Remember, as always, to explore patient’s expectations.","Food intolerance in children is common, and distinct from allergy/anaphylaxis, though the two can often be confused by parents. Food intolerance presents with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea/constipation and abdominal pain. The most common causes of food intolerance in children are from certain proteins and a specific paediatric acute presentation can be Food Protein Intolerance Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES), which can present with acute vomiting, diarrhoea and cardiovascular instability due to sympathetic dysfunction. A thorough history of recent food intake, past history of food intolerance and a family history of food allergies is important.

The consequences of missing a fracture as a cause of musculoskeletal pain is significant, especially if there is an underlying malignancy- understand what signs you are examining for, and which patients are more at risk. Apply the FRAX tool to patients with risk of fractures due to osteoporosis, review DEXA scan results and look up how they should be managed, and speak to your tutor about fracture prevention, especially in the frail elderly. Be aware of the limitations of medications use to treat osteoporosis, and discuss patient adherence. Speak to the safeguarding lead about identifying abuse, and how fractures and injuries suspicious for abuse are recorded and managed. ","Suspected fractures are a common presentation in the Accident and Emergency department, and so you are likely to see these on your acute care placement. Patients with a possible fracture will be investigated using x-rays to establish the diagnosis. Fractures are also a common condition managed in an outpatient setting in fracture clinics, after referral from A&E or a GP. You will commonly see fractures being managed on the wards and in theatres on your surgical placements. Effective and efficient management of fractures is important to prevent complications, including haemorrhage, compartment syndrome, fat embolism, chronic pain and venous thromboembolism. It is important to assess for fractures and injuries, particularly hip fractures, after a patient has had a fall on a ward. On medical wards you may meet patients with pathological fractures related conditions such as Paget’s disease, osteoporosis or in oncology patients who have metastatic bone disease.","Fractures and musculoskeletal injuries are very common in paediatrics, more common in males than females. A thorough history is important in order to exclude non-accidental injury, taking in to account the child’s developmental age and pattern of injury as well as the history of trauma that is provided. Unwitnessed injuries and those inconsistent with the child’s developmental age should be considered for referral to safeguarding services. Following first aid and analgesia, further management should include consideration of imaging of the involved musculoskeletal region. Consider referral to specialist orthopaedic services if appropriate depending on the extent of injury and likely long term consequences especially if close to the epiphysis.","See falls. Also, it is estimated that 1:3 women and 1:5 men, aged 50 and older will sustain a fracture in their lifetime. All types of fractures are associated with increased morbitiy and mortality and with decreased quality of life. Post fracture care should entail a multidisciplinary care trajectory offering screening as well as treatment for osteoporosis, with aim to reduce future fracture risk.

Frailty,PRES059,B,A,A,"Patients are less likely to present with frailty than one of the syndromes such as falls that suggest its presence. Screening for frailty in primary care is widely recommended. Think about how a practice would approach screening in a population at risk, how you might 'diagnose' frailty in patients you are seeing with cognitive impairment, infection or incontinence, and what tools you might use to assess a patient. Be aware of the contractual requirements to perform clinical reviews on patients who are frail, and what this consists of. Review the evidence of interventions including exercise, education, nutrition, counselling and hormone supplementation, and the relative ease of intervention related to effectiveness. How do practices support frail patients?","Frailty is a common syndrome in elderly patients and given an aging population, seen very often both in outpatient and inpatient settings. Whilst it is never the presenting issue, it is very often an underlying factor in a patient’s admission to hospital. You may see them in A&E, where the frailty contributes to a physical injury (e.g. a fall) or to decompensation secondary to an illness (e.g. delirium due to a UTI or a chest infection). Often, even if the presenting complaint is addressed (e.g. broken wrist has a cast), the patient may not be able to return to their home due to frailty and social concerns. This can result in a social admission, which carries the risk of hospital-acquired infections. These patients can also be found in medical wards, especially Care of the Elderly wards. You may see them in your psychiatry placement on old age wards, where frailty may occur in addition to mood disorders (depression or bipolar), psychotic symptoms (schizophrenia) or dementia (Alzheimer’s or Lewy Body dementia). ",No Paeds entry,"Frailty is a syndrome and may be defined in a number of ways. An easy way to think about frailty is a loss of physiological reserve, meaning that a new insult (infection, fall, medication change etc) may take longer for a frail patient to recover from. Consider trying to identify frail patients by using the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Score  https://www.bgs.org.uk/sites/default/files/content/attachment/2018-07-05/rockwood_cfs.pdf   Frailty syndromes include falls, immobility, incontinence, cognitive impairment and problems caused by polypharmacy.","Age UK,American Geriatrics Society,""Best practice guidelines for the management of frailty: a British Geriatrics Society, Age UK and Royal College of Physicians Report"",BGS Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Toolkit for Primary Care Practitioners ,Book: Nicholl CG and Wilson KJ.

Genetic screening,PRES060,C,B,B,"Be aware of patients who may request or merit genetic screening either antenatally (as routine screening, cell free fetal DNA or invasive tests), after presenting with signs or symptoms for conditions such as Hemochromatosis, or have concerns about their own or their children's risk of developing hereditable conditions such as breast cancer, Huntington's or muscular dystrophy. Think about the role of the GP and limitations in helping patients interpret results; identify where patients may be referred locally e.g. genetics, breast cancer family history clinics. Patients may also present with results from direct to consumer genetic testing- be aware of the limitations of these tests (e.g. false negatives, false positives), and the role of the GP in managing concerns whilst not referring to secondary or tertiary care on the basis of DCT results alone.","Genetic screening is now being used more widely and may be offered to a range of patients in secondary care to identify those at high risk, so providing them with preventative and early treatment options. You will come across genetic screening in specialities such as oncology, for example, where patients may be screened for the BRCA gene mutation or genetic screening for those with a family history of colorectal cancer. You will also see genetic screening being used in your obstetrics and gynaecology attachment as part of prenatal screening. Genetic testing can have ethical implications, and this underlines the importance of gaining a patient’s consent and offering genetic counselling. Genetic screening can become relevant in a range of conditions you may see in secondary care, including cystic fibrosis on a respiratory ward, haematological conditions such as sickle cell anaemia, as well as neurological conditions like Huntington’s disease.", , ,"(PH4) Screening,CEL11: Duties of Care & Candour,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Fetal Hydrops,Fetal Hydrops,Fetal Hydrops,Movement Disorders,Movement Disorders",8,"Applied biomedical sciences,Genomic Medicine",,Family history of possible genetic disorder,All areas of clinical practice
Haematemesis,PRES061,B,A,A,"Identify how patients who report vomiting blood are triaged and initially assessed and managed within primary care. Who should be referred immediately to A&E, who should be referred as a 2WW, and who merits a non-urgent endoscopy? Think about patients who may be reluctant or ashamed to admit to haematemesis, such as those with alcoholism and eating disorders, and who it is important to ask directly about vomiting blood. Discuss haematemesis in the context of end of life care, in particular how to manage an anticipated catastrophic bleed.","Haematemesis is a symptom that is usually seen in inpatient settings or in emergency care. The two main emergencies are oesophageal varices and gastric ulceration. Oesophageal varices are most commonly seen in patients with alcoholic liver disease due to portal hypertension, usually on a hepatic or gastroenterology ward. However, note that oesophageal varices can also be caused by other types of cirrhosis, thrombosis or parasitic infection in the form of schistosomiasis, so you may also see this in an infectious diseases ward or a surgical ward. Gastric ulceration makes up about 60% of haematemesis cases and may be found in endocrine (steroid use), gastroenterology (known active ulcer disease or H.pylori positive) or other medical/surgical wards (NSAID use). Boerhaave’s syndrome would present with haematemesis in a systemically unwell patient that has experienced forceful or repeated vomiting. It can also be caused by childbirth or seizures, so may be encountered in O&G or a neurology ward. A Mallory-Weiss tear is the non-emergency presentation due to the same cause. They may be seen in A&E in a patient with gastroenteritis, or you may encounter patients with bulimia in your psychiatry placement. ", ,"The key message for older people presenting with any bleed is to review medication and consider using reversal agents if they are on anticoagulation. The ABCDE approach is still important.

Haematuria,PRES062,B,A,A,"Whilst patients with visible haematuria may present (and are being encouraged to do so), a significant number of cases of non-visible haematuria are identified after patients have their urine dipped for other reasons- urinary symptoms, presentation with a rash or oedema, or as part of an assessment for diabetes or hypertension. Female patients are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage bladder cancer- think about why this may be, and review the NICE guidelines for referral. Be aware of common mimics of haematuria, the relevant history (including trauma and medication) and the possible causes within the kidneys, ureter, bladder and prostate/urethra. Speak to your tutor about management of renal colic locally. Be aware of causes of haematuria in children including IgA nephropathy, Wilms tumours and coagulopathies- discuss how you would assess them and follow up. Be aware of the issues for patients with long term catheters in the community who may also present with visible haematuria","Haematuria or blood in the urine is classed as either visible or non visible and can lead to A+E attendance, medical or surgical admission as well as present in Urology and Nephrology clinics. When visible, it can be an alarming symptom for the patient and may be accompanied by urinary symptoms such as increased frequency or dysuria but also systemic symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever and fatigue. Visible haematuria may be caused by urinary tract infection, a stone or malignancy of the kidneys or urinary tract. Haematuria can also be secondary to trauma to the urethral tract by a catheter so it is important to ask about this in the history and check for the presence of a catheter during examination. Visible haematuria is investigated with a urine culture to look for infection, blood tests to check kidney function, haemoglobin and infection markers as well as imaging of the urinary tract to exclude structural abnormalities. This may be followed by cystoscopy if any bladder or urethral abnormalities are detected. Non visible haematuria can also present with urinary symptoms or can be detected incidentally on a urine dip as part of a work up for abnormal kidney function. It should prompt similar investigations to rule out infection and structural causes and these can be conducted in an inpatient or outpatient setting. ", ,"see haematemesis, but also send a urine culture for microscopy and culture (do not rely on dipstick) and make sure if the patient is catheterised, that the catheter is not blocked and consider whether traumatic catheterisation has led to the haematuria","Acute Abdominal Pain,Acute Abdominal Pain,Acute Abdominal Pain,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,Cambridge University Health Partners field overview video - Acute kidney injury - Akimichi Inaba,Chronic Kidney Disease - Ruth Silverton,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Haematuria,Haematuria,Haematuria,Module 1 - Decision making and the cancer MDT,R&I autoimmune and vasculitis lecture,Renal Replacement Therapy - Ruth Silverton,Uropathology,Uropathology,Uropathology",18,Surgery,,Haematuria,"Cancer,Child health,Infection,Renal and urology,Surgery,General practice and primary healthcare"
Haemoptysis,PRES063,B,A,A,"Haemoptysis can vary from small amounts of blood streaked sputum to massive haemorrhage. Be aware that blood can come from other sources such as the nasal passage or mouth. Think about the patients presenting with other symptoms- e.g. breathlessness, fever, chest pain- whom should be asked about haemoptysis. It is the presenting symptom in only 20% of lung cancer (cough and dyspnoea being more common), and 6% of patients with Pulmonary Embolism (over 90% of these have dyspnoea and/or chest pain)- think about how you might distinguish between causes when assessing the patient. Be aware of the role of  investigations including imaging and sputum culture, and referral pathways to respiratory medicine or A&E. Review local antibiotic formularies, and discuss the use of criteria to rule out P.Es and point of care D-dimers with your GP tutor.","Haemoptysis is an uncommon but significant symptom, and can range from blood-streaked sputum to exsanguination. You are most likely to encounter this on respiratory wards and clinics, as most of the causes come under respiratory medicine (pneumonia, PE, lung cancer, aspergilloma, pulmonary vasculitis); you may also encounter it in oncology, cardiothoracic surgery or haematology. Bleeding may occur anywhere in the lung, from trachea to alveoli, and there may be a focal bleeding point or a more diffuse process; occasionally haematemesis or epistaxis may be mistaken for haemoptysis. As acute haemoptysis can be life-threatening, it is important to adopt an ABCDE approach to ensure your patient’s safety, and to consider whether they are anticoagulated (and if so, whether this should be reversed). Having established that your patient is stable, ask about the timecourse, frequency, volume and colour of blood, the presence of clots and associated sputum, and whether your patient has chest pain - this information will help you to determine the cause of bleeding.", ,see haematemesis; bear in mind that frail older people may not tolerate bronchoscopy and the risk-benefit of invasive investigations must be discussed.,"Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,British Thoracic Society Guideline for Bronchiectasis in Adults,Bronchiectasis and lung cancer - Dr Parth Patel - 1/6/20 ,Cambridge University Health Partners field overview video - Pulmonary embolism - James Garvey,Cambridge University Health Partners field overview video - Pulmonary embolism - James Garvey,Oncology case-based teaching 6 - Superior venacava obstruction,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,European Society of Cardiology 2019 Guidelines on Acute Pulmonary Embolism (Diagnosis and Management of),Haemoptysis,Haemoptysis,Haemoptysis,Interstitial Lung Disease and Bronchiectasis - Dr Catriona Davidson,Lump in the Neck,Lump in the Neck,Lump in the Neck,Module 1 - Decision making and the cancer MDT,NICE Guideline - Lung cancer: diagnosis and management,""NICE: Smoking: acute, maternity and mental health services"",NICE: Tuberculosis,Pneumothorax and Pneumonia - Dr Marianne Phillips - 23rd April 2020 (Year 5),""Pneumothorax, Pneumonia, and Pulmonary Embolism - Dr Marianne Phillips (Year 4)"",Pulmonary Pathology Index - The Internet Pathology Laboratory  for Medical Education,R&I autoimmune and vasculitis lecture,Radiology Masterclass website - Chest X-ray Abnormalities,Radiology Tutor website,Radiopaedia website - cases and imaging,Resp.net resources page,Respiratory examinations,Respiratory section of AnaesthesiaUK,Slides - Bronchiectasis and Lung Cancer,Slides - Interstitial Lung Disease and Bronchiectasis,""Slides - Pneumothorax, Pneumonia and Pulmonary Embolism"",University of Washington Images in Pathology,Tuberculosis,Recommended Cardio-respiratory medicine texts,Chest x-ray,eBook for Undergraduate Education in Radiology (ESR),www.learningradiology.com,Radiology Assistant,Radiology Cafe,Radiology Masterclass,Radiopaedia,Radiology Masters,3D printing and Radiology",46,Medicine,,Haemoptysis,"Cancer,Infection,Respiratory,General practice and primary healthcare"
Hair disorders including hirsuitism,PRES064,B,A,A,"Hair loss and excessive hair is a common complaint. Patients may discuss this as part of a spectrum of symptoms, or it may be their primary concern- some patients may be prompted to present by their hairdressers. Consider what information is important from the patient interview, including duration, location/pattern, associated symptoms and hair care practices. Thinks about the role of medical conditions & events (including major illness/surgery, stress, childbirth and thyroid disease), and which medication/drugs (including heavy metals) can contribute to hair loss. Consider what you will look for on visual inspection including skin and nail changes- if you work with clinicians who are familiar with dermoscopy, speak to them about what they would look for on examination. Hirsutism is also a common concern- consider what is normal for the patient, taking into account gender and ethnicity. Be aware of the role of androgens, and consider how you might assess for conditions such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and, more rarely, androgen -secreting tumours. Drugs such as testosterone may also be associated with hirsutism. Speak to your GP tutors about treatment options, including lifestyle advice for PCOS, and provision of direct methods of hair removal such as photoepilation in the private sector. Consider how to discuss reasonable expectations of treatment with patients.","Hair disorders are primarily a presentation that is managed in primary care by general practitioners, but there are a few instances that would necessitate secondary care referral to a dermatologist within an outpatient hospital setting. The key hair conditions that relate to a secondary care setting include alopecia areata and hirsutism, as these can be part of presentations of more systemic diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome in the case of hirsutism, with hair growth in androgenic areas in females. One issue with hair disorders is that it can be difficult to ascertain that exact type of disorder present, with many differentials present that could present a challenge to physicians in diagnosis. Learning what features in the history for each hair disorder can help differentiate hair disorder more suited to a primary care setting from those requiring referral to secondary care, and thus making a substantial difference to the management of your patients.

Hallucinations,PRES065,B,A,A,"Hallucinations, perceptions without stimuli, can be a reason for consultation in primary care, or may be described during a consultation when a patient presents primarily with other psychological symptoms. Hallucinations can be an isolated phenomenon or, more frequently, associated with other symptoms that need exploration. It is crucial to describe the hallucinations in detail and consider potential causes. Hallucinations can be due to medication/drug adverse effects, stress, psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders or even part of the normal development in children (e.g. an imaginary friend) or during the process of falling asleep or awakening. History will need to focus on the type of sense involved as hallucinations can affect all sensory modes and the content (e.g. auditory hallucinations could be noises, music, words or sentences) and frequency and duration. Potential pharmacological and non-pharmacological triggers (including withdrawal) and coexisting phenomena (e.g. delusions, headache, delirium, and dementia) will also provide clues to determine the origin. It is essential to understand the impact (how disabling is it?) and whether it is an alien or an everyday experience. Hallucinations are not always pathological, and can be transient and untroubling: many people mistakenly hear their name being called from time to time, or think they hear their phone ringing when it isn’t, and many doctors have hallucinated their pager/bleep going off.","People experiencing hallucinations can attend voluntarily or be brought to A&E by family members or police due to use/withdrawal of medications, legal or illegal drugs, and primary psychiatric disorders. Hallucinations can be seen in neurology clinics (e.g. epilepsy, migraine, movement disorder, and brain tumours), intensive care, post-surgery recovery and paediatrics. Hallucinations are a core presentation of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, but they are also common in other mental health problems, from child and adolescence to adulthood and old age.", ,"This is seen in Geriatric outpatients and on the wards. The most commonly seen halluciations in older patients are visual, though auditory and sensory should be asked about. New onset visual hallucinations are not usually due to pre-existing psychiatric illness and an underlying organic cause should be sought. Aetiologies include vascular, ophthalmic and neurodegenerative. Visual hallucinations are often unreported by patients as they fear they are losing their mind.

Head injury/brain death,PRES066,A,A,A,"The majority of head injuries do not require secondary care assessment or a CT scan, and are a common reason why patients and parents/caregivers contact primary care. What would prompt an urgent referral for CT? Would you assess all patients with a head injury face to face? What examination would you perform? Look up what advice and resources to provide patients with following assessment. Review the guidance on concussion, and look at the sports concussion assessment tool (SCAT)-  review how to support patients in the community who have been diagnosed with concussion. Patients who have had serious head injuries necessitating hospitalisation and surgery may have complex physical and psychological needs on discharge. Consider how this can be communicated with a patient's GP, and how they may best provide support and follow up after discharge. Think about the support the family of patients with serious head injuries or who have been diagnosed with brain death will require in the following months.","Head injury is an extremely common presentation in ED and on the wards (inpatient falls). Deciding which patients to investigate further, monitor or discharge with advice is a key part of the doctor’s role. NICE guidelines (outpatient setting) and hospital policy help with these management decisions.
Brain death is where the brainstem has been irreversibly damaged but the heart continues to pump and a ventilator keeps the body alive. The diagnosis of brainstem death is a very specialist skill reserved for expert clinicians. However, it is important to be aware of it, so that you can understand the delicate ethical issues surrounding it and answer questions that non-medically trained people may have.

Head size abnormality,PRES067,C,B,A,"GPs may assess head shape/size abnormality as part of the 6 week check, but also opportunistically when parents present concerned or reporting symptoms such as vomiting, squint, or abnormal movement. Consider signs of raised intercranial pressure, and review centile charts in the 'red book' to see if there has been a significant change. Be aware of positional plagiocephaly and how this can be managed and follow up. Find out what the local referral pathways are for paediatric assessment.","Head growth in a child occurs during the first couple of years of life, reflecting brain growth. Therefore, disorders of head size generally present in the routine newborn clinical examination, but can present later in the paediatric clinic. Abnormal head growth can be divided into microcephaly (small heads), macrocephaly (large heads) and skull asymmetry. Microcephaly can be caused by inherited genetic conditions, toxins during pregnancy such as alcohol or congenital infections, or acquired after a brain injury in early childhood. Since brain growth is correlated with head growth, these children often have intellectual disability with a poor prognosis for gain of normal brain function. Macrocephaly can be familial, but also caused by raised intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus, tumours or subdural haematomas. Head asymmetry can arise from imbalance of the growth rate of the skull sutures, or from premature fusion in the case of craniosynostosis.",The measurement of head circumference is an important step in the newborn examination and key in the evaluation of childhood growth and development. Medical students are expected to accurately measure and plot a head circumference and interpret the outcome. Think about what may cause a small or large head circumference and what further investigations may be required.

Headache,PRES068,B,A,A,"Headache is a common symptom for adults to consult about with their GPs (lifetime prevalence of over 90% in the UK population), and is associated with many conditions. As such, it is likely that you will encounter a patient experiencing headaches during your placements, either in isolation, or alongside other presentations. Consider what components of the history will help you assess whether this is a primary or secondary headache. What examination will you perform? What are the important ‘red-flags’ to consider & what would trigger a referral to secondary care? Think about when you might ask patients about headaches specifically (e.g. in antenatal assessments with the midwife, or during pill checks). Speak to your GP Tutors about their approach to this symptom. Consider what concerns patients may have, and how you might address these.","People with headaches frequently present to A&E and acute medical units, and are often seen in neurology and ophthalmology clinics, as well as ENT. However headache is such a common symptom that you may come across this anywhere - for example, the cardiac patient recently started on a nitrate, or the surgical patient recovering on the wards after being nil by mouth for several hours possibly triggering a migraine. The headache may not be the primary reason for presentation, but it can be a really severe symptom. Learning what features in the history help to differentiate primary from secondary headaches and how best to treat the different primary headache disorders can make a real difference to your patients.","Headaches are a common presentation in childhood and adolescence in both primary and secondary care. Headaches in very young children (<5 years) of age are a red flag and may be a sign of meningitis or other causes of secondary headaches. It is also important to realise that young children may not complain of headache but instead present with inconsolable crying or irritability. The incidence of headaches increases with age and are very common in adolescence. These headaches are often primary headaches including migraine and tension-type headaches. It is important to be able to recognise the rare presentation of a childhood brain tumour, think about how these children may present and what you could find on physical examination. ","Primary headaches are also common in the elderly, but there are a few conditions that must not be missed such as SAH, GCA, and SOL. In addition, many medications prescribed to older people for other common diseases may cause headaches ( eg pregabalin, opiates; dehydration commonly causes headaches and this maybe exacebated by diuretics; medication overuse for headaches, can ironically worsen headaches and even paracetamol when taken long term may start to cause headaches.

Consider how audit and primary care led research is employed to develop and improve both screening and health promotion e.g. the SAFER programme- screening for Atrial Fibrillation.","Whilst the initial stage of health screening takes place in the community, it falls to clinicians in secondary care to carry our further investigations and interpret results for whom the screen is positive. For example, the FIT test kit for bowel cancer screening is currently sent out to those aged 60-74. People with positive results then undergo a colonoscopy, typically performed by gastroenterologists in the hospital setting. It is important to understand the Wilson criteria as to what makes a good screening programme and why.
Health promotion is part and parcel of being a responsible hospital clinician. We have longer interactions with patients than primary care physicians and so have multiple opportunities to discuss lifestyle choices and the impact they have. In hospital you will see the end stages of many diseases and that will make you well informed to counsel patients on the risks and benefits of their choices. ","A good knowledge of newborn and childhood health screening and promotion in the UK is essential in paediatrics in order to advise parents adequately. Screening programs include newborn hearing, heelprick blood spot testing and newborn or 6 week examination in infancy, followed by dental, vision and hearing screening in primary school aged children. The childhood vaccination program should form a part of the health screening and promotion in children, ensuring the immunisation schedule is closely adhered to.","Continuing basic health advice (such as stop smoking, reduce alcohol consumption, eat heathily, and maintain a normal BMI; daily exercise) is really important even in the oldest old. Furthermore, ensuring patients do not suffer social isolation is essentail in maintaining good mental and physical health and maintaining independence. Social isolation has been shown to be linked to higher blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, anxiety, weakened immune system, depression, cognitive decline and dementia.","(HB1) Lifestyle Medicine,(HB2) Fundamentals of Nutrition,(HB3) Physical Activity,(HB4) Behaviour change,(HB5) Work and Health,(PH2) Inequalities - Children,(PH3) Inequalities - Disability and Health,(PH4) Screening,Breast disease and screening,Breast disease and screening,Breast disease and screening,Childhood development,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Introductory Course,""(IHS3) Linking Individual Health, Population Health and Services IH Systems 3 Year 4 GP"",Management of Population Health:  Predicting Risk in Primary Care Year 4 Seminar,Maternal & Child Health: Contraception,Maternal & Child Health: Neurodevelopment problems in children and young people,Microbiology & Virology Seminar,Preparation for an elective abroad,Reproductive Health in Primary Care,Genitourinary Medicine in the Community,Management of Chronic Disease in Primary Care; multimorbidity/frailty,Specialist Medicine: Early Detection of Cancer,Year 6 - Changing Behaviour,Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare",26,Improving health,,"Abnormal cervical smear result,Abnormal urinalysis,Wellbeing checks","Obstetrics and gynaecology,Acute and emergency,Renal and urology,General practice and primary healthcare"
Hearing loss,PRES070,C,B,B,"Hearing loss may lead to isolation, a reduction in quality of life and have an economic impact. Whilst most hearing loss is gradual and age related, acute hearing loss may be an emergency requiring urgent assessment +/- steroid treatment. Practice otoscopy and Weber's test, and find out about the role of community audiology services. How do surgeries identify and signpost patients for screening e.g. those with memory loss. Be aware of the options for managing wax including over the counter treatments.","Hearing loss can be categorised into conductive and sensorineural causes, which generally correspond to the middle and inner ear respectively. Rhinne’s and Weber’s tests can be used to differentiate these. Furthermore, hearing loss can be congenital, generally picked up during a neonatal ‘newborn hearing test’, or acquired. Most congenital hearing loss presents soon after birth, such as Pendred syndrome and Jervell-Lange-Nielsen syndrome (a type of long QT syndrome); but congenital hearing loss can progress more slowly, such as in Alport syndrome and otosclerosis, presenting later. There are numerous causes for acquired hearing loss, including foreign bodies, wax impaction, otitis media and otitis externa, Ménière’s disease, multiple sclerosis and acoustic neuromas. Drugs such as gentamicin can cause ototoxicity as an important cause of acquired sensorineural hearing loss. Noise trauma and presbycusis are perhaps the most common causes of acquired hearing loss in the more elderly population, where hearing aides play a role in treatment. Acquired hearing loss will be encountered in the ENT clinic, as well as in the emergency department.",A hearing test is an important aspect of the newborn screening as 1-2 out of every 1000 newborn babies have hearing loss in one or both ears. What is the timing of the newborn screening hearing test and what follow-up is recommended for children that fail the test? Hearing loss can also present later in childhood. Try to join an audiology clinic during a placement day with community paediatrics. ,"Age related hearing loss is of course, very common in older patients. It leads to communication problems, which in turn can lead to confusion and even lead to patient harm. It is essential to ensure patient's hearing aids are sought out, batteries are checked and audiology is contacted if there are any problems. Think laterally about improving communication with patients with hearing loss (see Geriatric pages on VLE).","(HB5) Work and Health,(PH3) Inequalities - Disability and Health,(PH4) Screening,Acute presentations in primary care Year 4 Seminar,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,History taking for ENT and Ophthalmology in Primary Care,Nervous System examinations,Neuroinflammation and Neurogenetics,Neuroinflammation and Neurogenetics,Neuroinflammation and Neurogenetics,Paediatrics - Paediatric ENT,Speciality online cases: ENT,Year 5 seminar: Abnormal Neurodevelopment,ENT and Ophthalmology examinations",14,ENT,,Hearing loss,"""Ear, nose and throat"",Medicine of older adult"
Heart murmurs,PRES071,B,A,A,"Whilst valvular disease and other structural changes within the heart may present with symptoms such as fever, chest pain, breathlessness, blackouts and faltering growth, murmurs may be identified routinely during a 6 week check or when examining the chest for unrelated reasons. Murmurs are common in the elderly, and you may identify flow murmurs from a hyperdynamic circulation due to infection, thyroid disease, pregnancy or infection. Finding a murmur prompts a search to find out if this is a new finding within the patient's record, and consideration of a possible cause. Think about what other symptoms and signs you should assess for. What is the access to echocardiography like, and which patients would you refer to cardiology, paediatrics or A&E.","Cardiac murmurs are additional sounds that are heard between normal heart sounds. They are common to encounter in the emergency department and during your placement in the different wards. They reflect turbulent blood flow through the heart. Such turbulence can be due to narrowing (stenosis), leakage (regurgitation) or stiffness (sclerosis) of a heart valve. They can also occur due to an increase in the velocity or the volume of blood flowing across a valve, causing relative narrowing of a normal valve. Murmurs can be broadly categorised into innocent (physiological) and pathological. Innocent murmurs can be heard in toddlers, young adults, pregnant ladies and thyrotoxicosis. They can also be heard in elderly patients with sclerotic valves. The commonest causes of pathological murmurs in the hospital environment are age-related degenerative aortic stenosis, infective endocarditis, connective tissue diseases (e.g. Marfan syndrome) and congenital heart diseases (e.g. bicuspid aortic valve).
If you find a murmur on cardiac examination, it is important to time it with a central pulse (carotid or subclavian). Murmurs synchronous with the pulse uprise are called systolic murmurs, and those heard during the pulse descent are called diastolic. The timing of the murmur and identifying the area of maximum intensity are crucial to identify the underlying valve pathology. Murmurs can sometimes be heard in areas away from their actual origin, and the area of propagation can give a clue to the underlying valve pathology. For example, if you hear a systolic murmur that is heard loudest on the aortic area and propagates to the carotid arteries, then it is likely aortic stenosis. Pulse examination can help you confirm the underlying valve pathology; for instance, a high-volume collapsing pulse happens in aortic regurgitation. Echocardiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing underlying valve pathology.","Heart murmurs in children can be due to physiological or pathological changes, and may be identified as a result of symptomatic cardiovascular abnormalities or on a routine examination such as the 6 week check as an incidental finding. A thorough systemic examination for other signs/symptoms pf cardiovascular disease will obviate the need for echocardiography looking for structural and dynamic changes of the heart. Take in to consideration the age of the child, past medical history such as previous cardiac abnormalities/surgery and a preceding history of infection/pallor/anaemia.","heart murmurs are very common in older people. Always check in the notes to see if this finding has been mentionned previously and always look for old echocardiograms. Heart murmurs may also be heard with anaemia and heart failure. If an older patient has had a syncopal event and has a systolic murmur, in the absence of other features of aortic stenosis, it is highly unlikely that the syncope is due to AoS i.e. you would expect the patient to have had had lightheadedness, chest pain etc. ","Cardiovascular and Peripheral Vascular examinations,CCM lecture 1 - Chest X-Ray,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Pyrexia of undetermined origin,Pyrexia of undetermined origin,Pyrexia of undetermined origin,Week 1 - Pre-assessment and Cardiovascular Health,Year 5 seminar: Murmurs and congenital heart disease,Year 5 Cardiology Toolbox",9,Medicine,,Heart murmurs,Cardiovascular
Heartburn,PRES072,B,A,A,"Whilst heartburn is commonly understood to mean dyspepsia, and is part of a set of symptoms including abdominal pain, acid reflux and nausea that are usually due to gastrointestinal causes, it is important, as ever, to clarify exactly what the patient is experiencing so as not to miss other causes of pain & discomfort such as cardiac or hepatobiliary/pancreatic disease. Heartburn is common, and the majority of people will manage their symptoms conservatively, through diet, or over-the-counter medications. Think about which symptoms would prompt immediate referral for possible acute gastrointestinal bleeding, and review the local and national guidance for urgent referral for exclusion of malignancies. What component of the history, including lifestyle and medication are relevant? Be aware of tests available to primary care, including stool antigen testing, a full blood count and direct access to endoscopy. Speak to your tutors about who they will refer, who they will  'test and treat', and how patients are followed up. Ask the team about patients on long term treatment for acid suppression or gastro-protection and how this is reviewed. Heartburn is very common in pregnancy- be aware of the treatment options available including lifestyle factors and medication (and where you would look up safety data for medication use in pregnancy women).","Heartburn' is a term used colloquially by patients to describe a burning sensation in the middle of the chest or epigastric region. It is often associated with an unpleasant sour taste in the mouth caused by stomach acid. Patients may also complain of a chronic cough, hoarse voice, bad breath, nausea and bloating. Most people find particular foods, such as spicy food or alcohol, can also trigger symptoms. Pregnancy related heartburn is also a common complaint, arising due to decrease in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure caused especially progesterone, as well as increased intrabdominal pressure.
In secondary care, heartburn can often be a presenting symptom of several acute emergency conditions. Myocardial infarction may present as severe central chest pain. Alternatively, mild complaint of heartburn can also be a presentation of myocardial infarction. As such, an ECG is important in all complaints of heartburn in secondary care. Atypical presentations such as this are more common in females and patients with diabetes.
Heartburn may also be seen in the acute care setting in the context of alcohol withdrawal, particularly if following a recent binge. More concerning signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include tremors, seizures, anxiety, headache, vomiting, sweating and insomnia. The CIWA score is used to assess the severity of alcohol withdrawal and determine inpatient treatment.
Another secondary care context which you may encounter heartburn is for the patient presenting to the emergency department with undiagnosed oesophageal and/or gastric cancer. Persistent acid reflux (known as gastro-oesophapgeal reflux disorder or GORD - also contributed to by hiatus hernia) and as a result heartburn can lead to Barrett's oesophagus. This is where the lining of the lower oesophageal mucosa undergoes metaplasia, with normal squamous epithelium changing to columnar epithelium. This increases the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma at 50-100 times. As there is no surveillance programme, oftentimes, patients may ignore symptoms and attend the emergency department with complaints of heartburn, dysphagia, weakness and severe weight loss, having already developed oesophageal adenocarcinoma. It is worth noting that some oesophageal patients may be treated with radiotherapy to the area, this also causes severe heartburn due to the irritation caused to the area. Symptoms normally begin during the 2nd to 3rd week of treatment.
Peptic ulcer disease is another major cause of heartburn encountered in secondary care. This may be from a gastrin-secreting tumour leading to over production of acid in the stomach, Helicobacter pylori infection or long term use of NSAIDs or steroids. With regards to the latter, concurrent protein protein pump inhibitor prescription such as Omeprazole is important to mitigate this risk.", ,Heart burn is a common symptom and consequently is treated with PPIs.

Hoarseness and voice change,PRES073,C,C,B,"Hoarseness, a change in vocal quality, is a symptom with the highest individual risk of laryngeal cancer and may be picked up whilst speaking with the patient. Review the common causes of hoarseness and voice change and consider what other symptoms, findings or investigation results would make malignancy or neurological causes more likely. Have a look at the 2WW guidance locally, and be aware of how you would safety net in a patient presenting with a short lived change in their voice suspected to be acute laryngitis. Laryngitis and Laryngo-tracheitis, related to viral upper respiratory tract infections and croup are common in children, but consider alternative diagnoses such as reflux, nodules, trauma and congenital abnormalities and  referral onwards for further assessment.","Voice hoarseness can be described as a raspy, breathy or strained voice -which may be lower or higher in pitch or softer in volume. It is usually accompanied by a feeling of a 'scratchy throat' although sometimes patients have no change in sensation to the throat. Usually hoarseness as a symptom indicates a problem with the vocal folds of the larynx, more colloquially known as the 'voice box'.
The mechanism of action of sound production by the larynx is via vibrations of the vocal folds, which are two opposite facing bands of smooth muscle tissue in the larynx. The larynx is defined as the area between the base of the tongue and the start of the trachea, which leads to the lungs. The vocal folds remain open during breathing, however during speaking the brain controls snapping of the vocal folds whilst air pushes past from the lungs, resulting in their vibration and resulting sound waves. These sound waves resonate through the throat, nose and mouth, which can modulate the sound also. Pitch, volume and tone is determined by the shape and size of the resonating cavities and the vocal folds. As this is uniquely different from person to person, people's voices are also uniquely different.
Several conditions may affect the larynx and cause hoarseness or voice change, some of which can be addressed in the community such as gastro-oesophageal reflux, laryngitis (viral infection of the larynx or 'voice box'), voice overuse or smoking. Untreated hypothyroidism may also result in a low-pitched and hoarse voice, although most people are diagnosed before later stage symptoms such as this occur.
However, there are other conditions which will be encountered and require management in the secondary care context, for example, vocal fold paralysis. Vocal fold paralysis occurs when there is dysfunction of the opening or closing of one or both vocal folds. This can be caused by trauma to the head, neck or chest; laryngeal, thyroid or lung cancer; tumours of the chest, neck or skull base; or infections such as Lyme Disease. It is worth noting that a '2 week wait' suspected cancer pathway referral to an ENT specialist should be undertaken in those ≥45 years with: 1) persistent unexplained hoarseness or 2) An unexplained lump in the neck. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) or laryngeal papillomatosis, can also cause hoarseness due to vocal fold paralysis by the growth of non-malignant tumour growth in the larynx and other air cavities from the nose and mouth. Branches of the vagus nerve - the superior and inferior laryngeal nerves, are the primary innervation to the vocal folds. Neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke may also experience vocal fold paralysis due to dysfunction of the nerve supply to the vocal folds from the central nervous system. Spasmodic dysphonia is another rare neurological condition that causes hoarseness via vocal fold paralysis and can also affect breathing. There are also cases where the cause of vocal fold paralysis is unknown. Regardless, treatment will include addressing the underlying cause, voice therapy and in some instances surgery.
Vocal cysts, polyps and nodules (sometimes known as ""singers nodes"" due to frequent occurrence amongst singers) also cause hoarseness and can require secondary care attention. Similar to RRP, these are non-malignant growths however they occur specifically within or along the vocal folds. Nodules appear in pairs on opposing sides of the vocal cords, polyps typically occur on one side and cysts appear as a hard tissue mass enclosed in a sac inside the vocal fold. All arise due to too much friction or pressure on the area and are treated in the same way with voice rest, voice therapy and surgery to remove the cysts/polyps/nodules.", ,"This is commonly seen in older patients and the differential is wide: neurological diseases including parkinson's disease, MND, Stroke, myasthenia gravis; however, also consider primary vocal cord problems such as vocal fold paralysis and vocal fold atrophy and consider early involvement of ENT, as laryngoscopy is a simple and well tolerated procedure. Voice quality does tend to diminish with advancing age, and is often multi-factorial, but should always be fully investigated and should not simply be ignored as part of physiological ageing. Speech therapy may help dysphonia and this greatly improves quality of life and communication for older people.","Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,History taking for ENT and Ophthalmology in Primary Care,Lump in the Neck,Lump in the Neck,Lump in the Neck,Lymphadenopathy,Lymphadenopathy,Lymphadenopathy,Nervous System examinations,Speciality online cases: ENT,Wed pm neurology seminar series: Motor Neuron Disease ",11,ENT,,Hoarseness and voice change,"""Ear, nose and throat"",Endocrine and metabolic,Respiratory"
Hypertension,PRES074,A,A,A,"A diagnosis in its own right, hypertension may be identified in diverse locations such as 'well man checks', pre-op assessments, work medicals, joining a gym, or when an optician is concerned about retinopathy. Given the established links to morbidity and mortality, it is important that you are able to identify and confirm the existence of hypertension. Think about the encounters in primary care where this is relevant, such as diabetic reviews, assessment of pregnant women, and pill checks, and take the opportunity to practice taking accurate readings. Be aware of the symptoms and signs that  may present with that indicate elevated blood pressure and in particular, know when you would refer for same-day specialist assessment, including in obstetric cases. Speak to the team about how they diagnose hypertension, using clinic readings, and ambulatory or home monitoring, and what investigations are done for target organ damage and cardiovascular risk. Consider what factors would make you consider referral for assessment of secondary causes. Be aware of the cut offs that NICE advise for treatment in different groups of patients and what options are available. How does your practice support lifestyle interventions for patients with hypertension? Do they use decision aids? Identify how patients with hypertension are followed up at your practice, and in particular be aware of some of the issues associated with striving for lower blood pressure targets in populations such as the frail elderly.","A significant proportion of hospital patients will have some degree of hypertension, which can be the reason for attendance to A&E but is often not the primary reason for their admission. Hypertension plays a factor in management of patients across secondary care, from a peri-operative point of view where it requires optimisation prior to surgery, to aiming for target blood pressures when patients are admitted for strokes. Also consider some secondary causes of hypertension such as Cushing’s disease or phaeochromocytoma as sometimes these may require different styles of management. The medications utilised to manage hypertension may also contribute to hospital admission, e.g., ACE inhibitors contributing to an AKI and/or additionally contributing to a hyperkalaemia. Blood pressure targets may not always be as keenly controlled during hospital admission – consider why this may be in terms of short term to long term risk.", ,"NICE guidelines suggest aiming for below 150/90 for patients over 80.  24 hr BP monitors are very useful in guiding BP management in the elderly; it is worth encouraging patients to buy their own BP machines and asking them to send you their own readings from time to time. For patients who are on long term anti-hypertensives, always check their L&SBP. It is also important to check what tablets a patient actually takes at home rather than just asking them what their GP has prescribed for them. Many patients have polypharmacy and can not cope with the numerous prescribed tablets; if their BP is poorly controlled in hospital, it is important to establish what meds they are taking regularly before increasing the current dose. Make sure the patient understands the risk of high blood pressure and what each tablet is for so they are informed and can make their own decisions. Beware the older patient with supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension.

Hypotension/Shock,PRES076,B,B,A,"Rapid identification of patients who are at risk, and the signs and symptoms of shock in primary care is vital- think about how this might be elicited through online triage systems or over the phone. For surgeries in remote locations or when there is likely to be a delay in ambulance attendance, what steps can the team take? Familiarise yourself with the NEWS2 system.
Identifying those patients who are at risk of developing hypotension (for instance, due to dehydration, medication or adrenal insufficiency) and shock due to sepsis is important-  think about how to safety net using online resources, and the provision of 'sick day rules' for patients on steroids or taking nephrotoxins or immunosuppressants. ","Hypotension is a serious process that can occur for many reasons, ranging from drug induced to sepsis to major haemorrhage. Septic patients representing a significant proportion of hospital admissions, for this reason A&E is a likely place where you may see hypotensive or even shocked patients. Patients can and do deteriorate on wards however, and recognition of the sick patient is a key skill to develop prior to starting as a doctor. Remember that hypotension is relative to the patient, as their baseline blood pressure can be lower than expected but equally noting that a patient’s BP is normally high, a usually ‘normal’ blood pressure may indicate relative hypotension. Stratifying types of shock can be helpful from a pathophysiological point of view, identifying what treatments are most appropriate for different types of shock. Being familiar with fluid boluses in hypotension and balancing risks in patients with heart failure is not an uncommon scenario also. Postural hypotension is a condition particularly prevalent in the elderly population and is a significant contributor to falls and subsequent injuries e.g. neck of femur fractures. For this reason it is extremely important to identify patients who have hypotension, or are at risk of falls due to undiagnosed postural hypotension in order to prevent this disease burden.", ,"Treat sepsis urgently; in managing hypotension in the absence of sepsis in the elderly, always do a medication review.

Hypothermia/hyperthermia,PRES077,C,B,A,"It is important to identify those patients who are at risk of accidental hypothermia, including extremes of age, alcohol use, homelessness and psychiatric disease, especially in times of fuel and financial crisis. Be aware of the role of the primary care team and social prescribers in addressing risk. The symptoms of hypothermia can be subtle initially and assessing for a reduced core temperature should be standard when seeing patients with altered mental state, tachypnoea, dysarthria or shivering. Remember that sepsis in elderly patients may present with hypothermia, and that children have limited ability to shiver and maintain body temperature, and may present with paradoxically rosy cheeks. Think about initial management in primary care whilst waiting for an ambulance. Hyperthermia in response to heat stroke, metabolic disease or medication, can be fatal- advise patientsand carers how to manage exposure to extreme heat and about the symptoms of serotonin syndrome where relevant.","Hypothermia is a relatively rare presentation in secondary care, though those of you in A&E may encounter it more often. It is defined as core body temperature below 35C. Accidental hypothermia is the most common type. Those most at risk are the elderly, infants and homeless persons. Other independent risk factors include substance misuse (via impaired homeostasis), autonomic neuropathy, and cognitive impairment. Important causes include general anaesthesia - especially during induction, hypothyroidism, and gram-negative septicaemia for which hypothermia is an often underappreciated sign. Given that hypothermia is diagnosed by a thermometer it is difficult to miss, but important red flags include confusion, respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension and counterintuitively an absence of shivering – this implies severe hypothermia with a core temperature below 32C. Those of you well versed in advanced life support will also recognise hypothermia as one of the 8 reversible causes of cardiac arrest so you can appreciate the importance of early recognition and reversal.

Hyperthermia is distinct from fever in that it derives from a failure of thermoregulation as opposed to inflammatory response. Common associated symptoms include sweating, muscle cramps, vomiting and sometimes seizures. These associated symptoms will often be the presenting complaint and in isolation are not uncommon, but in combination with raised temperature should set off alarm bells. Heat stroke is more common during hot summer months, particularly in patients partaking in strenuous exercise. As seen with hypothermia, the elderly and youngest population are most at-risk. Certain medications such as diuretics, beta blockers and anticholinergics can also increase risk. Less common but equally serious causes include salicylate poisoning, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome. You could encounter any of these in A&E. Those of you on anaesthetics should also be aware of malignant hyperthermia in which susceptible individuals enter a hypercatabolic state on administration of anaesthesia.", ,"Older adults commonly have lower core body temperature and altered thermoregulatory responses. In short, this is due to age-related physiological changes, but is also compounded by the presence of  comorbidities. This means that in an individual, single-point measurements of vital signs have less sensitivity in detecting disease processes. For example, in one series of older adults with pneumonia, only 50% of patients mounted a fever. Thus, it is important to treat older patients as individuals and follow the trend of their individual vital signs rather than relying on population norms. Fever in older patients is neither sensitive nor specific for infection. Although a fever of >38 degrees increases the probability of bacterial infection in older adults, there are many other causes of PUO. Equally, the absence of a fever in an older adult does NOT rule out infection. As always with older people, a comprehensive assessment is required examing all systems.","Cardiovascular and Peripheral Vascular examinations,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Thyroid examinations,Endocrine,ECGs made easy",5,Emergency medicine,,,Endocrine and metabolic
Immobility,PRES078,B,B,A,"Like frailty, immobility is a  common consequence of multiple diagnoses, and has significant risks for a person's health. How often do you here it mentioned in the context of an elderly patient? Consider what information you will require to perform a comprehensive assessment for reversible causes, including a collateral history, review of medication, physical assessment and investigations where appropriate. Speak to GPs about the practice's approach to maintaining continuity for elderly patients and those with complex care needs. Be aware of the importance of assessing for pressure areas, and the role of the community teams and district nurses in prevention and management. For children presenting with new immobility, be aware of possible causes such as fractures and the need for urgent assessment +/- safeguarding.","Immobility is a common to see in A&E and in clinics. Can be an acute presentation, acute or chronic. Acute causes would be flare ups of gout or osteoarthritis, acute heart failure, stroke, pleural effusion. So similarly, to history taken in a primary care setting, you would assess the cause of the patient’s underlying immobility. Since it encompasses many possible causes a focused history of underlying issues is essential. What would the relevant investigations be needed (eg, CT/MRI if a stroke is suspected, x-ray knee if presenting with knee pain). In addition, assessment of how patient mobilise, walking aids, what can be done to improve their quality of life.

Key message: never accept immobility as a primary diagnosis; it is nearly always of multi-factorial aeteiology and is best addressed with Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and MDT. Search for reversible elements with a goal of maintaining as much independent function as possible.

Your practice may let you participate in the vaccination programmes for 'flu and Covid-19- take the opportunity to understand how the vaccines work and the role of herd immunity.","Immunisation is the major public health success story of the past century, having reduced incidence by >96% pertussis, diphtheria, measles, haemophilus influenza b, group C meningococcal disease. Unfortunately, a significant amount of misinformation surrounding the associated risks of vaccination, (historically the MMR vaccine, more recently during the COVID-19 pandemic). How would you approach discussing vaccinations with a patient who had “anti-vax” beliefs?
In addition to the standard programme of vaccinations offered in the UK, additional vaccinations are offered to some individuals, for example if they are immunocompromised (e.g. post-splenectomy) or planning to travel abroad. A thorough vaccination history should be gathered in patients presenting with signs and/or symptoms of communicable diseases (e.g. COVID, fever in the returning traveller, influenza, meningitis).",It is important to be aware of the routine immunisation schedule for children. Which diseases are included in the schedule and at what age are they given? Understanding at what age children are more susceptible to certain infections because they have not yet been immunised is just as important.  Always include immunisation status when taking a history in children.,Always encourage older people to have their flu and covid vaccines. Reasons for avoiding vaccine would include current illness (but encourage to have once recovered); palliation or severe immunodeficiency. All patients over 65 should have a pneumococcal vaccine as a one-off vaccine; the shingles vaccine is available to patients between 70-79; it has been to be less effective once aged over 80," (PH1) Paediatric Immunisations,(PH7) Communicable Disease and Environmental Hazards,05 Vascular liver disorders - video,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Genitourinary Medicine in the Community",5,Improving health,,"Travel health advice,Vaccination","Infection,General practice and primary healthcare,Child health"
Incidental findings,PRES161,B,B,A,"Incidental findings are results from investigations that clinicians are not directly looking for, and are relatively common (e.g., incidental findings are present in 6-15% of people having brain imaging), and may lead to further, sometimes unnecessary, tests and financial, environmental, or personal costs. Organisations such as NICE, the GMC and Royal Colleges provide guidance that aims to rationalise the use of investigations for conditions such as lower back pain in primary care- speak to your GP tutor about how this influences their investigation and management of a patients. Think about how this guidance, and the risk of incidental findings is communicated to patients who are requesting investigations that aren’t immediately indicated. Consider the positive and negative impacts of the recent increase in private health checks and direct-to-consumer (DTC) access to investigations such as blood tests (e.g., via Superdrug), imaging and DNA home testing kits (e.g. 23andMe) . Speak to the primary care team about their experiences with patient’s presenting with incidental findings from these tests such as deranged LFTs or non-HDL-C levels, in the context of the current model of 10-15 minute GP appointments. What conversations might be had because of a DTC finding of elevated risk for conditions such as breast cancer or Alzheimer’s Disease?",,,,,0,,,Incidental findings,All areas of clinical practice
Infant feeding problems,PRES080,B,A,A,"A common cause for parental concern in general practice, feeding issues may present as faltering growth (failure to thrive), symptoms of allergy or concern about Gastro-oesophageal reflux (which is a normal physiological process in healthy infants) and the associated symptoms of discomfort or pain. Breastfeeding parents may present with pain or mastitis due to difficulty feeding. Speak to the primary care team about monitoring of babies in primary care, including the role of the health visitor and the 6-week check. If you can, speak with the health visitors and midwives, or attend new baby checks. What support is available for breast feeding mothers before and after delivery in the area? Discuss with your tutor what assessment you would make of an infant who seemed to be struggling to feed due to discomfort, difficulty latching or tiring. What would prompt a referral to paediatrics, and how would you follow up and support patients in primary care? Have a look at the GP Infant Feeding Network for helpful advice.","Difficulty feeding during infancy or poor feeding is a very common presenting complaint in secondary care and is associated with a broad range of differential diagnoses. An acute reduction in oral intake or issue feeding can be a non-specific symptom in a generally unwell infant (e.g. neonatal sepsis) or represent an acute abdominal issue. It is crucial to ask about associated symptoms, such as vomiting or constipation, to lead you towards more specific differentials such as pyloric stenosis or hirchsprungs’ disease.
Patients with more chronic feeding problems can generally be managed in the community – which other allied health professionals might be involved? Infant feedings problems that have led to severe malnutrition, particularly in infants <6 months, may result in admission to hospital for a period of supported feeding (sometimes via enteral or parenteral routes) and careful monitoring due to the high risk of refeeding syndrome.","Infant feeding problems is commonly defined as impaired oral intake in children less than 1 year of age and usually has a multifactorial aetiology. Common causes of feeding problems such as colic or thrush are relatively harmless but other more serious causes need to be ruled out. Feeding problems are more commonly seen in preterm infants and in infants with developmental delay and there may be anatomical or neurological abnormalities. This problem may be encountered on maternity wards, in primary, secondary care or tertiary care. Think about common causes if infant feeding problems and how to assess and manage them.

Intimate partner violence and domestic abuse,PRES038,B,A,A,"Domestic violence and abuse is defined as any incident of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour, violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members, regardless of gender or sexuality. It includes psychological, physical, sexual, financial and emotional abuse, as well as ‘honour’-based violence and forced marriage. Anyone can be a victim of domestic violence, and every healthcare appointment may be an opportunity to identify those at risk. The primary care team may be well placed to spot people at risk given their involvement with patients and their families over longer periods of time. How does the surgery create an environment that makes it possible for patients to disclose abuse? Think about how to ask sensitively where you suspect abuse- have a look at the HARK questionnaire. Speak to the GP safeguarding lead about how to act following disclosure, and how to document and share information between health care and social care groups. Safety should be prioritised, and patients should be provided with information about support. Speak to your tutor about how the wider family, and especially children, are managed when domestic violence is suspected or disclosed.","Domestic violence involves a pattern of abusive and controlling behaviour from an abuser. It is sadly seen throughout society, and many victims will experience recurrent episodes of domestic violence before seeking any help. Domestic violence is associated with more than just physical injury. Victims of this are more likely to have psychiatric diagnoses and are more likely to self-harm. Victims may also present frequently with multiple and poorly defined complaints (such as non-specific abdominal pain). You will encounter domestic violence in all areas of secondary care, and victims may present directly or indirectly, with medical complaints related to the domestic violence. As medical professionals we are in a crucial and privileged position to recognise domestic violence and initiate the process of support that may stop the process of violence. As a medical student you may be the first person that domestic violence is disclosed to, it is important to explore concerns in a sympathetic and non-judgemental manner and escalate appropriately. ", ,"Elder abuse is increasing.  A recent BMJ editorial from Dec 2021 suggests if affects 1 in 6 people over 65, globally. It is much more common in patients with dementia and a recent report from the House of Lords suggests it is common, poorly measured and hidden from society. Abuse all may take forms, but particularly psychological and financial abuse are thought to be the most common. It is important to remember that all forms of abuse are now a criminal offence and we should all be aware and actively looking for it. It is important to weigh up the doctor-patient confidentiality against breaking that confidence in the patients' best interests to escalate concerns to adult safe guarding if abuse is suspected.","(PH5) Sexual and Gender Minority Health,(PH6) Violence as a Public Health Problem ,CEL4: Achieving Good Medical Practice,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Neurosurgery Lecture TWO - paediatric neurosurgery,Pre-operative assessment lecture",6,Improving health,,,Social and population health
Intrauterine death,PRES081,C,A,A,"All healthcare workers involved in the care of pregnant women should understand the importance of symptoms such as decreased foetal movements, pain and bleeding, and understand which emergency pathways to use to ensure patients are managed quickly and appropriately. Speak to the primary care team about their role in the care of a patient/family in the aftermath of an intrauterine death. Talk about the purpose of the ‘6 week check’ in this scenario, what support services are available for families, and how a previous loss in pregnancy might impact patients who are trying to conceive and during a subsequent pregnancy. Think about the importance of how information is shared between maternity services, community midwives and primary care in order to prevent assumptions being made, and to ensure that patients are cared for compassionately.","Loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks is defined as miscarriage, with the majority of these occurring in the first trimester, while stillbirths or intrauterine fetal death describes those babies born dead after 24 weeks of gestation. While miscarriages can affect up to 30% of all pregnancies, stillbirths are rarer - encountered in 1:200 births. You will most commonly see the management of miscarriage in early pregnancy units, where staff will be experienced in sensitively helping patients through what is often a very distressing event. Diagnosis may be made during a routine pregnancy scan or when a pregnant patient presents with PV bleeding. Serial beta-hCG and trans-vaginal ultrasound scans are key investigations. Expectant management can be appropriate for most patients, with a rescan in 2 weeks to ensure products completely passed, but more involved medical and surgical management may be requested by the mother or required in certain cases. Heavy bleeding at any stage may also require inpatient management for haemorrhagic shock. Stillbirth is most often diagnosed by absent fetal movements and confirmed via ultrasound. Investigations typically include maternal blood tests to investigate for potential causes such as fetal-maternal haemorrhage and infections, and to inform management going forward for labour. The presence of risk factors such as sepsis or pre-eclampsia will necessitate acute induction, but otherwise expectant management can be an option, with appropriate monitoring for complications such as DIC, and the decision can be led by the mother’s preferences. With both, the psychological after-care of the mother and any partners is extremely important, and you may have a chance to experience this in outpatient follow-up appointments that look to support the bereaved parents. Specialist recurrent miscarriage clinics or genetic counselling may also play a role in longer-term management depending on the context.

Involuntary movements,PRES082,B,A,A,"Involuntary movements may present in Primary Care in a variety of manners- from patients who are on anti-Parkinson’s medication, to children with Tic disorders. Consider what features of the involuntary movements you will want to be aware of, such as when it occurs, and which part of the body is affected. Think about what associated symptoms may be important (such as cognitive impairment or weakness). Identify what is important in the patient’s history (e.g. stroke, recent changes in medication), and what the appropriate management might be in terms of referral.","Involuntary movements may be encountered in neurology and care of the elderly clinics, as well as paediatric outpatients, psychiatry wards and clinics and stroke inpatients. Tic disorders are common in the young whereas in older people side-effects of medications are more common. Functional neurological disorders can also present in this way. Movement disorders are commonly seen in association with antipsychotic treatments and treatments for Parkinson’s disease, all of which act on dopamine receptors. How would you differentiate drug side-effects from a stroke (a cause of hemiballismus), or the very rare example of Huntington’s disease (HD)?

Jaundice,PRES083,B,A,A,"Occurring when plasma bilirubin is raised, jaundice can be an important marker of underlying malignancy, bile duct pathology or hepatitis. Often apparent when reviewing a patient face to face, think about how you can assess for jaundice remotely. Consider what signs and symptoms would prompt you to admit a patient to hospital, and what investigations you would undertake (and how promptly) in those who do not require an admission. What are the important components of a history, including red flags? What does a ‘full liver screen’ consist of? Whilst on placement, take the opportunity to review blood tests, particularly LFTs, and interpret the results. Familiarise yourself with the referral pathways locally and speak to the clinical team about how they manage palliative patients or those patients with known alcoholic liver disease when they develop jaundice. Jaundice is also a common finding in newborn babies and may prompt a call from parents or health visitors. Be aware of what constitutes physiological jaundice and how to assess and refer an infant appropriately.","Pre-hepatic, hepatocellular, cholestatic. You will be taught early on to classify the array of causes of jaundice, and within each of these categories there will be presentations across a spectrum of acuities in the secondary care setting. From the otherwise well patient referred by GP to ambulatory care for investigation of incidental finding of abnormal liver function tests, to patients who are brought in by ambulance to resus, acutely encephalopathic or bleeding from varices. There are those who will require highly acute intervention, such as haemolysis secondary to malaria or DIC, fulminant hyperacute liver failure caused by hepatitis or paracetamol overdose, or acute cholangitis presenting with jaundice as one of Charcot's triad. But you will also see jaundice presentations that may largely resolve with conservative management such as a flare of alcoholic hepatitis after a binge, a mild viral hepatitis or a drug induced cholestasis triggered by a common culprit – the ubiquitous course of co-amoxiclav.

The role of the hospital will be to provide supportive management for the unwell patients that need it, while determining the cause of the jaundice, usually aided by the battery of blood tests that form the non-invasive liver screen and most commonly an ultrasound of the abdomen as the imaging starting point. The cause, once delineated, will typically signpost to the next management steps, which can involve a variety of specialties. Patients with common bile duct stones may need IV antibiotics and retrieval of stones via ERCP. Jaundice in decompensation of liver cirrhosis can be the harbinger of more serious complications such as bleeding from oesophageal varices or hepatic encephalopathy that may require urgent endoscopy and ITU for airway support respectively. There may be a new diagnosis of hepatocellular, biliary or pancreatic malignancy that will need urgent referral to oncology to determine treatment options. And there is increasing scope for liver transplants in patients with both acute and end-stage chronic liver failure. You will also see jaundice in outpatient clinics such as hepatology, perhaps suggesting decompensation of previously stable chronic liver disease, or oncology, where it may be a heart-sinking sign of progressive disease in the form of new liver metastases.  ","Jaundice in neonates is common and can be physiological or pathological. Symptoms can be appearance of jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, abdominal pain and failure to thrive. To investigate the underlying cause, the bilirubin level and fractionation in to conjugated/unconjugated should be considered. Predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia should always be considered pathological and further investigated with liver function tests and hepatobiliary imaging. Management depends on the underlying cause, and prompt diagnosis is critical in certain situations such as biliary atresia. Treatment of physiological jaundice will depend on the bilirubin level and age of the baby.","the 3 main causes of jaundice in older adults are malignancy, medications or gallstones. Many antibiotics may induce cholestatic liver injury resulting in jaundice; Jaundice is also commonly associated with pruritis in the elderly (compounded by dry skin- part of physiological ageing)","01 Overview of liver disorders talks - slides,01 Overview of liver disorders talks - video,02 Acute liver disorders - slides,02 Acute liver disorders - video,03 Chronic liver disorders - slides,03 Chronic liver disorders - video,04 Biliary liver disorders - slides,04 Biliary liver disorders - video,05 Vascular liver disorders - slides,Coma,Coma,Coma,Common Presentations of Hepatology - Dr Fotios Sampaziotis,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Gastrointestinal examinations,Hepatology 'wiki' for clinical students      ,Hepatology 2 - biliary disorders (Will Gelson),Inherited Liver Disease webinar - Bill Griffiths,Jaundice,Jaundice,Jaundice,Liver disease,Liver disease,Liver disease,Managing Hepatology Emergencies as an FY1 (Catriona Davidson),""Recorded teaching session - GI exam, Liz Goode"",""Slide deck - GI Exam, V Mulcahy"",""Slides, Liver Tumours - Matt Hoare"",Year 4 - Initiating the Medical Interview,Year 5 seminar: Introduction to Neonatology,Year 5 seminar: Jaundice",31,Medicine,,Jaundice,"Cancer,Child health,Clinical haematology,Gastrointestinal including liver,Obstetrics and gynaecology"
Joint pain,PRES084,B,A,A,"Joint pain is a common presenting symptom in primary care, and may be the main reason a patient consults, or may be part of a constellation of symptoms. Patients with joint pain are increasingly encouraged to self-refer to physio services such as DynamicHealth. However, primary care clinicians must be able to identify conditions that can affect any joint (such as osteoarthritis or gout), and those that affect specific joints such as Patello-femoral pain syndrome or Osgood-Schlatter disease. They also need to be able to exclude serious conditions such as septic arthritis or Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, and consider systemic causes of joint pain such as Rheumatoid Arthritis or the menopause. You are likely to see or speak to patient presenting with joint pain during your time in primary care. Speak to the GP tutors about what information they use to make decisions such as who to investigate with imaging or blood tests, who to start treatment in, and who to refer to the musculoskeletal triage service. Does the surgery offer joint injections? Consider too the role of the GP in encouraging self-care and advising about lifestyle changes such as exercise.","Patients with mechanical/osteoarthrotic joint pain are usually managed in primary care, since conservative approaches, to facilitate the wear, tear, repair process, are often sufficient. However, some patients may require surgical approaches, if things fail to settle, so osteoarthritis is most likely to be seen in secondary care during orthopaedic placements - both in outpatients and for elective joint replacement. Patients with inflammatory joint pain (whatever the cause) are likely to be seen in rheumatology clinics. Since it can sometimes be difficult differentiating inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint pain patients with osteoarthritis will also sometime come to rheumatology clinics. Acute monoarthritic joint pain (potentially due to crystal arthritis or septic arthritis (particularly if the joint is red and swollen)) will usually be seen in acute assessment units (if referred from the GP) or in A&E, since the joint needs aspirating. More polyarticular autoimmune joint pains can be linked with more systemic problems (rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, SLE, sarcoidosis etc) and so patients in a variety of medical in-patient and out-patient settings may also have inflammatory joint pains that require assessment.","Joint pain in children usually affects large joints more frequently than small joints and the former is more commonly associated with trauma or injury. Other common causes of joint pain in children include infection and autoimmune conditions. A thorough history is warranted including asking about preceding trauma/injury, systemic infections and a family history of autoimmune conditions. Consider what threshold to use to begin investigations such as duration of pain, limitation of movement, inability to weight bear and systemic signs of fevers or rash. Local and systemic infections should be used to triangulate the underlying aetiology, and would include bloods for infection/inflammation, and imaging of the joints looking for effusion or bony erosion.","In older patients, joint pain is commonly a secondary complaint i.e. an older patient only complaining of joint pain is more likely to be seen in Rheumatology or Orthopaedic clinics. However, joint pain may be extremely debilitating and many older people may have so many co-morbid conditions that mild to moderate joint pain is easily dismissed as being part of normal ageing. It is essential to examine all joints in older people, particularly if they present non-specifically with fatigue, confusion (i.e. one of the Geriatric syndromes) as inflammed joints may be missed without full assessment.","(HB5) Work and Health,(PH3) Inequalities - Disability and Health,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,Analgesia and NSAIDs,Analgesics lecture,Arthritis,Arthritis,Arthritis,""Article: Turner J, Gittoes N, Selby P; Society for Endocrinology Clinical Committee.

Learning disability,PRES085,C,B,B,"Learning Disability is defined as 'a significantly reduced ability to understand complex information or learn new skills; a reduced ability to cope independently; and a condition which started before adulthood with a lasting effect'. You may identify that patients you are seeing for diverse reasons have a LD- be aware of the increased risk of co-morbidities, and the impact that LD may have on identifying and managing conditions such as mental health problems, obesity and epilepsy and the risk of poly pharmacy (in particular psychotropic medications). Find out what percentage of patients in your practice have a learning disability and how the significant health inequalities for people with LDs is addressed nationally and at a practice level. How is annual flu immunisation and screening made inclusive? What is included in an annual health check? What communication strategies do you observe the primary health care team utilising?","Patient with learning disabilities may present in all areas of secondary care, inpatients and outpatients. Patients with learning disabilities are more likely to suffer with chronic disease than the general population but also susceptible to the same disease/conditions as the general population. Some congenital conditions associated with learning difficulties such as Down’s Syndrome are also associated with other congenital issues, such as cardiac abnormalities, and these patients therefore often have issues with chronic disease needing long-term secondary care input. Patients with learning disabilities health and wellbeing can be affected in a variety of ways. Some patients are relatively independent with minimal social, or nursing input and other patients can be completely dependent for all care. Occasionally patients with more severe learning disabilities can present atypically due to reduced communication. Collateral history from care providers and family is important here to understand how the patient might be trying to communicate their needs.", ,"NICE guidance: older people with learning difficulties should have regular health assessments as these patients may find it difficult to express their needs and be heard (use link). The life expectancy is lower than in general population (approx 15 years); they are more likely to develop serious health conditions such as epilepsy and pneumonia and are more likely to die from these conditions due to late diagnosis.

Limb (arm or leg) pain,PRES086,B,A,A,"It is often difficult for patients to differentiate joint pain from muscular, neurological, bony or vascular causes of limb pain, so it important to take a full history and identify who needs examining and how urgently. Think about how the move towards remote consulting during the pandemic has impacted on this assessment. Consider in particular how you might identify Peripheral Arterial Disease, and Acute Limb Ischaemia, given the high morbidity and mortality of missed or delayed diagnosis. Consider what would concern you in a child presenting with limb pain (and see ‘Limp’) Think about how you might manage patients in primary care, using tools such as handheld dopplers, blood tests, or referral onwards to Radiology, Msk, Rheumatology or Vascular. Speak to your tutor about their team’s approach to managing pain conservatively with analgesia- what do they prescribe, if anything, and how do they attempt to minimise side effects or addiction.","Limb pain can be caused by joint pain and so both inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint pain can present as limb pain. Where you will see these patients is shown under joint pain. Limb pain can also be seen in rheumatology clinics with patients with chronic pain problems such as fibromyalgia (generalised central pain amplification) or complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS - localised to an individual limb). CRPS is also seen following fractures and so is sometimes seen in orthopaedic fracture clinics. CRPS and fibromyalgia may be managed through multiprofessional pain services and so you may also see these patients in pain clinics. Referred pain radiating into a limb can be due to other organ symptoms (cardiac (arm pain), gall bladder (shoulder tip), pelvic (leg pain)) and so may be seen in many medical and surgical clinics. Neuropathic limb pain (either upper or lower limb) can be due to nerve compression/injury and patients with neuropathic limb pain may be seen in rheumatology, neurology, orthopaedic, neurosurgery and chronic pain clinics.","Limb pain in paediatrics can be a manifestation of multiple aetiologies ranging from musculoskeletal limb pain, referred joint pain, neuropathic pain or bony pain. When assessing a child with limb pain, identify whether it is unilateral or bilateral, localised to a joint/bone, duration, frequency, analgesia, as these will help determine the severity and nature of the pain. Pain that wakes a child at night is considered significant until proven otherwise. Consider systemic signs and symptoms such as fever, which may indicate a joint infection, e.g. septic arthritis; pallor, lethargy, which may rarely be associated with malignancy.","limb pain very commonly seen in Geriatric clinics and wards, think: cellulitis; oedema secondary to heart failure; acute and chronic ulceration secondary to venous and arterial problems; claudication and rest pain leading to necrosis; diabetic neuropathy and foot ulcers; pressure sores on heels secondary to immobility (think waterlow score essential in IP); arm pain often caused by cannulation or repeat phlebotomy; DVT in both upper and lower limbs; ","Analgesia and NSAIDs,Analgesics lecture,""Article: Turner J, Gittoes N, Selby P; Society for Endocrinology Clinical Committee.

Limp,PRES087,B,A,A,"Limp, an abnormality in gait caused by pain, weakness or deformity, may be noted as part of a consultation for other reasons, or may be the primary cause of concern. Perhaps the most important presentation to consider (and see the paediatric category below) is the limping child. Whilst acute traumatic injuries are common in children (and should always be assessed through the lens of Non Accidental Injury), it is important to think about emergencies such as septic arthritis, testicular torsion, underlying malignancies and osteomyelitis. Think about how you will assess patients who are limping in order to identify better the location of the abnormality and the underlying cause.","Limp can be caused by a variety of neuromuscular and joint problems. Patients with an acute limp following trauma will be encountered in A&E, orthopaedic fracture clinics as well as other surgical specialities such as neurosurgery. Patients with chronic painless limping may be seen in neurology and geriatric clinics/wards. Painful limping may also be seen in rheumatology and orthopaedic clinics, particularly where it is thought that it may be due to inflammatory or non-inflammatory joint pain or limb pain (see other presentations for more details).","Limp in children commonly represents pain, usually associated with traumatic injury, but could also be related to growth abnormalities such as leg length discrepancy or undiagnosed/untreated developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Take a general and specific history relating to recent trauma, fever, recent viral illness and lethargy/pallor, which may indicate whether there is an infectious/malignant underlying cause. A past medical history of risk factors for DDH is helpful. In older children a specific pain history can also be helpful. Limping in children should always trigger safeguarding and consideration of non-accidental injury. ","Limps are commonly seen in older people and you should always watch your patient walk to your clinic room or down the ward to look for any gait abnormalities. A limp implies a gait disorder of some sort and of course, the first place to start is the history. How long have they had the limp? Any preceding events? Any walking aids and how long have they used these for? In older people, gait disorders are very common. It can be useful to objectively score a gait disorder to try and quantify a limp- such as the Tinetti gait score. It is frequently multi-factorial, as arthritis (for many reasons) is common; as well as cerebrovascular disease including small vessel disease. Of course, the differential is very broad and a full assessment is required. Input from both the physio, occupational therapist and orthotics department can be very helpful in improving QoL and independence .","Clinical Assessment of the Musculoskeletal System Guide,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Foot and Ankle,Functional neuroanatomy - How to localise a lesion,Functional Neurological Disorders resources,GALS and REMS Examination Videos - Versus Arthritis,GALS Examination - Cambridge video,GALS Screening Examination - Versus Arthritis learning resource,Knee Osteoarthritis,Knee Pain,Knee pain - Osgood Schlatter,Limb deformity correction in children - Miss Elizabeth Ashby (2021),Limping Child,MSK Infection - Periprosthetic Joint Infection,MSK introduction to diagnostic reasoning,Musculoskeletal examinations,Nervous System examinations,Oxford Handbook of Rheumatology Chapter on drug treatments,Patella Instability,R&I autoimmune and vasculitis lecture,UOC 2019 - Foot and ankle examination,UOC 2019 - knee examination,UOC 2019 - spine examination,Versus Arthritis health professionals and students...,Wed pm neurology seminar series: Neurological gait disorders,Year 4 - Gathering Information,Year 6 Senior Surgery foot & ankle examination seminar,Year 6 Senior Surgery hip examination seminar,Year 6 Senior Surgery knee examination seminar,Spinal Examination video,Knee Examination Video - Arthritis Research UK resource,Foot & Ankle Examination - video,Oncology extension teaching resources",33,MSK,,Limp,"Child health,Musculoskeletal,Neurosciences"
Loin pain,PRES088,A,A,A,"Discuss the common causes of loin pain in primary care, and think about how patients are triaged, and who you should ask specifically about loin pain. Think about the physical assessment, which may reveal signs of infection, shock or an acute abdomen. How are patients managed whilst awaiting an ambulance in GP for renal colic or a possible ruptured aneurysm? Who should have imaging, and when- review the guidelines for renal colic and malignancies locally.","Loin pain is a common symptom often encountered acute setting most commonly the emergency department. Causes may relate to the urinary system and therefore this symptom can also be encountered in Renal and Urology wards or respective outpatient clinics. Patients may present with severe acute pain or milder chronic pain, and it can come in isolation or with associated other symptoms such as haematuria or dysuria. History-taking is important to differentiate between different medical and surgical causes such as pyelonephritis, urinary obstruction, renal masses or even referred back/musculoskeletal pain. ", ,"Sub-acute or chronic loin pain may be referred to a geriatric clinic, and acute loin pain is frequently encountered on a Geriatric ward. Traditionally loin pain is referred to the urologists to assess for renal stones; however, in older frail people, loin pain is also sent to Geriatricians. For older people, it is important to think broadly for the differential: for instance, renal ischaemia from dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm could present with loin pain, especially in older people with a long history of cardiovascular risk factors","Acute Abdominal Pain,Acute Abdominal Pain,Acute Abdominal Pain,Analgesia and NSAIDs,Analgesics lecture,Chronic Pain lecture,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Haematuria,Haematuria,Haematuria,Pain management MSK Year 4 lecture,Pathological fracture,Pathological fracture,Pathological fracture,Revision notes in cardiovascular physiology,Week 4 - Analgesia and Oxygen",16,Surgery,,"Acute and chronic pain management,Loin pain","Acute and emergency,Cancer,Neurosciences,Obstetrics and gynaecology,Palliative and end of life care,General practice and primary healthcare,Perioperative medicine and anaesthesia,Surgery"
Low mood,PRES089,B,A,A,"Low mood is a common symptom and a key feature of a number of mood (affective) disorders, including depression. Not everyone with low mood is depressed, but mood disorders are very common: for example, about 12% of people have depression at some point in their life and about 4% of people have depression in any given month. GPs diagnose and manage a large fraction of people with depression. A sensitive approach, allowing enough time, is key. You should know how to screen for depression using the two NICE questions (relating to mood and anhedonia) and how to diagnose depression symptomatically (such as with the ten-symptom criteria used by ICD-10). If you suspect depression, you should always ask about suicidality (practise this -- it’s not easy at first), and try to ask about a history of mania/hypomania because this affects treatment. How might you treat depression, and what features might lead you to refer to secondary care? Although “primary” depression is common, and depressive symptoms are common in several other psychiatric disorders, there are many “secondary” causes to be alert to (including endocrine disturbances, inflammatory conditions, neurological diseases, and both recreational and prescribed drug use). There is overlap with other presenting problems, such as fatigue.","Low mood, when accompanied by suicidal thoughts or acts, is a frequent presenting problem in the Emergency Department, and severe affective disorders (sometimes with psychotic symptoms) are a common reason for psychiatric admission. Low mood is also extremely common in general hospitals; sometimes this is depression or a related affective disorder, but sometimes it is part of a normal reaction to traumatic events, part of the response to severe systemic inflammation, or part of delirium (which is itself a syndrome, not a final diagnosis). All specialties see people with low mood and should be able to screen for depression and suicidality. Some situations present elevated risk, such as the postpartum period. Liaison psychiatry teams assess and manage patients with suspected psychiatric disorders in acute hospitals.", ,"Low mood may often present as one of the Geriatric Giants for example, decreased mobility or decreased cognition (eg  a patient may be referred as they have 'taken to their bed'). Recognition of depression in older patients presenting to the emergency department is poor (figures from British Geriatric Society). 29% of older hospitalised patients have depression and this may mask as multiple physical symptoms such as pain, loss of appetite and weight loss. Among older adults, there is a much stronger assoication between self harm or completed suicide and mental health problems than in adults of working age. 15% of older adults with a first episode of self harm, go onto repeat the act and there is a 49 fold increase in the risk of suicide. Early involvement of the old age psychiatrists should be sought.","(HB5) Work and Health,(HB6) Addictions,Anxiety disorders,""Application of Genetics in Endocrinology, pt 1 - Dr Ruth Casey"",""Application of Genetics in Endocrinology, pt 2 - Dr Ruth Casey"",""Article: Koulouri O, Gurnell M.

Lump in groin,PRES090,B,A,A,"Noticed by a patient or parent, or identified when you exam someone for symptoms such as pain, weight loss or an undescended testis, groin lumps are a common finding. Be aware of how to examine for hernias and what features are of concern- have a look at the local proforma for surgical management. Consider the possible causes of lymphadenopathy, and the referral pathways for adults and children when malignancy or genital infections are suspected. Think about who you would request further investigations in, and practice safety netting with each other and your tutor.","Patients can develop a lump in the groin due to a myriad of causes from benign to medical emergencies (strangulated hernia). Just depending on the consistency, we can roughly estimate if it's from a medical, surgical, vascular or oncological cause. Metastasis from cancer present in the limbs or the anal canal will constitute a firm and hard node. A pulsatile mass may be an iliac or femoral artery aneurysm. Valsalva will reveal any inguinoscrotal or femoral hernia. Inguinal lymphadenopathy seen in infection or inflammation of the limbs generally gives a rubbery feeling. Gathering history regarding pain, systemic complaints, bowel & bladder habits, and history of sexual contacts are integral. A rectal exam is necessary if the patient has any change in bowel habits. The degree of pain can determine the urgency of the situation like in an incarcerated hernia. The examination should be performed both standing and supine. Good clinical examination (consistency of the mass, appearance location, characteristics), associated systemic complaints, degree of pain, good history, and using imaging such as ultrasound and CT scans can help determine the source of the lump.","A groin lump noticed by the child, parent of incidentally during medical examination for other reasons may be related to enlarged lymph nodes, undescended testis or hernia. The site, size, mobility, tenderness and transillumination should give clues to the underlying cause. Take a thorough history about duration of the swelling and associated pain, fevers, undescended testes or recent infection. Further imaging and investigations should consider ultrasound or other imaging to identify the nature of the swelling. ","Hernias are very common in older people, due to the progressive weakening of collagen tissue of the abdominal wall as part of physiological ageing. Patients may not consult their GP as may be stoical and have low expectations that anything can be done. Although there is a higher risk of morbidity with an emergency repair, the risk of elective surgery using local anaesthetic is both safe and effective in older people and age should not be a contraindication to seek surgical advice. If a patient does wish to consider surgery, then physiotherapists should be able provide a truss for symptomatic benefit.","Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Oncology extension teaching resources",2,Surgery,,Lump in groin,"Cancer,Clinical haematology,Gastrointestinal including liver,Surgery"
Lymphadenopathy,PRES091,C,A,A,"Though you may see patients presenting reporting lymphadenopathy, you will almost certainly find lymphadenopathy when examining patients, particularly children, presenting with other symptoms such as ear pain, breast tenderness or skin rashes. Make examining for lymph nodes part of your usual assessment of a patient in primary care, and think about features of the history and exam that would allow you to reassure a patient. How would you safety net? What aspect of the history and findings on examination would prompt you to do urgent bloods- if so, which blood tests- or refer onwards for imaging or secondary care input? Review the NICE guidance on suspected cancer diagnosis. Remember the importance of considering conditions such as HIV and TB in the general population- how should these patients be initially assessed locally ","Enlarged lymph nodes can be caused by a broad range of differential diagnoses, many of which are benign. When lymphadenopathy is the presenting complaint, careful history-taking and thorough examination are required to delineate which cases are concerning for underlying aetiologies which require prompt further investigation and treatment. The most common and concerning causes include infections, malignancies, autoimmune disorders and iatrogenic secondary to medications.
In secondary care, you will most commonly encounter these patients in the emergency or outpatient settings. In the former, this may be patients presenting with acute infective symptoms; clinical judgement is required to determine which are related to self-limiting conditions such as infectious mononucleosis and adenovirus, and which need urgent further investigation such as in cases of suspected tuberculosis, viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus. First presentations of malignancies are increasingly commonly being seen in emergency department, with localised or generalised lymphadenopathy being detected clinically or through cross-sectional radiological imaging.
In the outpatient setting, you may see patients with malignancies such as leukaemia and lymphoma being followed-up in haematology clinic, and solid malignancies in oncology or organ-specific specialist clinics. Non-malignant causes of generalised lymphadenopathy can be encountered in rheumatology clinic with cases of rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. ","This is a very common presentation and incidental clinical finding in children of all ages. To differentiate between infectious and non-infectious causes of lymphadenopathy, a careful history and examination followed by appropriate investigations may be necessary. The duration of lymphadenopathy, location and feeling is important. Think about when it would be appropriate to radiologically image clinically enlarged lymph nodes to look their underlying architecture, in association with blood tests to investigate for malignancy versus infection. While most lymphadenopathy in children is self-limiting, persistent enlargement of lymph nodes should be considered for biopsy to exclude sinister causes. Certain locations for enlarged lymph nodes including supraclavicular nodes should always be considered pathological. ","This is commonly found in older people and a full examination is essential. Don't forget to examine groin, axillae, breast examination, and inside of the mouth, as well as the cervical region. The differential is wide.

Major trauma,PRES092,B,B,A,"Many GPs will not be directly involved in the acute stages of a major trauma, however, emergency care is a core skill of general practice, and a GP in a rural setting or stopping at an incident may need to provide initial support. Primary care has an important role in supporting patients and relatives in the aftermath of major trauma given the short and long-term health consequences. Are their patients at your practice who have experienced major trauma? Review the communication between primary and secondary care, including discharge summaries, and requests for GP involvement. Think about the coordination of services such as physiotherapy, mental health, and occupational therapy, and the importance of continuity and communication.","Major trauma is any injury which is life-threatening or has the potential to cause prolonged disability. The first encounter of these patients will be in the emergency department – here you will see clinicians carrying out primary surveys to detect life-threatening or life-altering injuries, and decisions being made about what radiological imaging is indicated. If the hospital is not a major trauma centre and there are indicators of severe injury which were not detected by the out-of-hospital team such as more than one body system having an acute injury, a decision will be made in conjunction with a trauma centre about whether to transfer the patient to a specialist hospital.
If any acute surgical intervention is required, these patients can then be seen in theatre under the care of the relevant specialty/specialties (ranging from trauma surgeons to orthopaedics to vascular to plastics…). Post-operatively they will be moved to the surgical wards, or frequently to the intensive care unit if they require organ support or sedation for adequate analgesia due to the severity of their injuries.
Once discharged, patients who have experienced major trauma can be encountered in a variety of outpatient settings. They may require further operations or other therapies to improve function and reduce disability. The psychological impacts of their experience and subsequent care must also be addressed, so they often attend psychotherapy/psychiatry clinics. They may also be left with chronic or difficult-to-control pain, and may be seen in pain clinic to help manage this.","Major trauma in children is usually associated with high-speed motor vehicle accidents, but other injuries such as falling from a height and non-accidental injuries, which should always be considered and safeguarding triggered if appropriate. Injuries usually result in bony fractures, haemorrhage or visceral injury. Patients usually present to accident and emergency as triage category 1 and should have a primary assessment for obvious injuries to the chest, abdomen and head, following by secondary survey of the limbs once airway, breathing, circulation have ben stabilised and internal haemorrhage identified/excluded. Assess for bleeding, pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade immediately, using A&E expertise. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) scan may be useful in the resuscitation bay before proceeding with formal imaging once the patient is clinically stable.","The nature of major trauma is changing and now forms two distinct syndromes. In the developed world traditional ‘high energy transfer’ major trauma (young, male, road traffic collision) has become the minority, as ‘low energy transfer’ major trauma (older, female, fall on one level) has become more common.
The older major trauma patients are just as seriously injured as younger patients, but they are not identified by the prehospital trauma triage tools and are difficult to identify in the Emergency Department. This means that older major trauma patients don’t have direct transfer to a Major Trauma Centre, don't have a trauma team response in the ED, are looked after by more junior staff, have delayed investigations (such as CT), and delayed intervention. Major trauma systems are set up to optimise treatment for ‘high energy transfer’ major trauma, so may not be appropriate for major trauma in older patients.
The commonest severe injuries in older people are to the head and chest. These severe injuries are often ‘stealth trauma’ so not immediately recognised, with an underlying theme that the focus of clinical care is on the associated intercurrent acute medical illness. It may not be in the best interests of every older person to be immediately transferred to a major trauma centre (as few will require intervention), but for every patient there is the requirement for urgent multi-speciality and multi-disciplinary decision making.","Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) Overview lecture,Cardiovascular and Peripheral Vascular examinations,CCM lecture 5 - Trauma radiology,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Introduction to orthopaedics seminar,Introductory Course,Major Haemorrhage,Major Haemorrhage,Major Haemorrhage,Musculoskeletal examinations,Nervous System examinations,Neurosurgery Lecture TWO - paediatric neurosurgery,Shock,Shock,Shock,Student presentations,Trauma - Limb Trauma  Viability,Trauma and Pelvic fractures",18,Emergency medicine,,"Acute kidney injury,Trauma","Acute and emergency,Child health,Renal and urology,Perioperative medicine and anaesthesia,Medicine of older adult,Musculoskeletal,Neurosciences,Surgery,Clinical imaging,General practice and primary healthcare"
Massive haemorrhage,PRES093,A,A,A,"Massive haemorrhage, leading to shock and change in mental status, must be recognised as soon as possible. Think about the scenarios that may be encountered in primary care, including in older people on anticoagulation, pregnant patients, and palliative patients. Find out what the surgery's response patients presenting with a suspected bleed is- how are they triaged? What equipment do the team have to manage patients prior to hospital transfer? Be aware of the risk of bleeding on medication such as DOACs, and how you might explain this to a patient at risk of VTE or stroke. ","Massive haemorrhage can arrive as an emergency to the A&E Resus, or be seen in hospital as a post-operative complication or on the OT table. Massive haemorrhage is defined against the physiological response of heart rate more than 110 rpm and blood pressure less than 90mmhg (Systolic) after a blood loss of 4litres within 24 hours, 2 litres in 3 hours and >150ml/min. Priority is given to stopping any external bleeding and starting ABCDE assessment immediately. Simultaneously start transfusion of O -ve blood and fresh frozen plasma at a 1:1 ratio, and consider tranexamic acid if appropriate. Good communication among team members is vital. The patient may become unresponsive so always prioritise connecting patients to a cardiac monitor as well. Good exposure and clinical examination may uncover hidden sources of bleeding. Bedside FAST ultrasound scans can be used to detect free fluids in the abdomen. While managing the patient, especially post-traumatic, any change in vital signs should trigger ABCDE examinations as there could be new sources of bleeding. If bleeding is successfully stopped patient should be shifted to ICU and monitored for further complications(coagulopathy) and further imaging may be considered. If bleeding is not controlled and the patient is bleeding despite all external efforts, a patient needs to be surgically explored for controlling the bleeding.", ,"Massive haemorrage is encountered in older people who  have suffered major trauma (see major trauma) but also seen in older people on DOACS, and even more so in older people on triple therapy (DOAC, aspirin and clopidogrel).  Real world studies of patients on DOACs show that the oldest old (>85) had the highest risk of any major bleeding (intrancranial and GI) though the overall benefit of stroke reduction is also greatest is also greatest in this group.

Melaena,PRES094,A,A,A,"Patients may present with a clear history of melaena, but more commonly it is the job of the clinician to identify the story of black, tarry stool when a patient reports a change in bowel habit, abdominal pain, or vomiting blood. What are the risk factors for an upper GI bleed? Incorporate these questions into your history, and be aware of examination findings that might suggest liver disease, or right sided colon/small bowel pathology. Think about how you would assess and initially manage adults and children presenting with a likely upper GI bleed in the community, and who should be referred for immediate assessment & endoscopy.","Malaena refers to black, tarry stools produced by the digestion of blood via intestinal enzymes. Malaena is commonly caused by an upper GI bleed. Malaena can be a presenting symptom in patients being admitted to secondary care (ED or GP referral) as well as inpatients. Patients with melaena can be seen in any hospital setting. Certain patients will be at higher risk than others. For example: hepatology patients with cirrhosis and known varices (variceal bleed); cardiac patients being treated for ACS on DAPT; the patient with a PE diagnosis started on treatment dose LMWH. It is important to recognise the clinical and biochemical features of UGI bleeding.

Memory loss,PRES095,B,A,A,"Whilst patients may present worried about memory loss, more often, it is relatives or carers who prompt an appointment with a GP when they notice a change. In any patient presenting with changes in personality, communication, mood, language, hallucinations, parkinsonism or visuospatial deficits, it is important to assess memory. Where possible, your history taking should include a collateral history from someone who knows the patient well. The GP relationship may be helpful due to continuity- within your practice do staff have time to discuss patients? Remember that patients may be upset by the suggestion their memory has changed, especially given the implication and concern about dementia, and some may mask the symptoms well. Look up shorter cognitive tests such as the GPCOG and 6-CIT, and practice asking about memory and using them during consultations- but remember that a normal score does not rule out dementia. Could this be delirium? Discuss reversible causes with your GP tutor including medication- especially anticholinergics, infection, alcohol withdrawal and constipation. Think about what appropriate testing can be done in primary care- memory loss can also be a common symptom of the perimenopause and menopause, or may be exacerbated by hearing or visual changes. Look up the local referral pathway for memory loss, thinking about who you might refer for an urgent neurological assessment +/- imaging, and have a look at a letter from the memory clinic or speak to a patient to understand what is done there. In your practice, how are patients with dementia or a diagnosis of memory loss supported? Be aware of the bigger picture including employment, driving, advance care planning, difficulty with medication adherence and attending appointments, and support for carers.","Memory loss tends to co-exist in a large percentage of patients presenting to ED and inpatients, typically the older adult. It tends not to be the main presentation to secondary care in isolation. For example, in the younger patient with a head injury, amnesia is a indication for urgent CT imaging; in the older patient presenting with a delirium on a background of dementia, an urgent CT is unlikely to be indicated in the absence of a history of falls/head injury/anticoagulation usage. Establishing if the memory loss is acute or chronic is also important; in instances of acute amnesia, CT imaging may be required. Taking a collateral history is imperative when evaluating memory loss and will assist in distinguishing underlying cognitive impairment e.g. dementia, from delirium.", ,"Memory loss (both acute and chronic) is commonly seen on both the IP wards and the clinics. There are an estimated 675,000 people with dementia in England, the majority of whom are over 65 and have comorbid health conditions, making them particularly vulnerable to develop severe symptoms and complications. They are supported by a similar number of carers, most of whom are older people themselves. A quarter of people in acute hospitals and three quarters of residents of care homes have dementia.

Menopausal problems,PRES096,B,A,A,"The physical and psychological symptoms that the Perimenopause & Menopause may present with are numerous, incorporating a significant number of other ‘patient presentations’ such as Sleep problems, Panic/anxiety, Vulval Symptoms, Sexual Problems, Palpitations, Headache and Joint Pain. Each patient may have a different onset, severity or combination of symptoms that impact on their personal life, work life, physical and mental health to a different degree. It is important to consider the impact of this presentation on a person’s underlying health such as cardiovascular risk and bone density. In primary care, even if a patient does not expressly mention the menopause, consider whether it may be a contributing factor to their presentation. Does the surgery you work in have a GP or NP with an interest in this- if not, what provisions are there for female patients locally? Are there well woman clinics? Menopause support groups? Think about the role of the primary care team in addressing areas such as bone health, cervical and breast screening, and cardiovascular disease in individuals and their practice population.",The symptoms of menopause will be usually managed in primary care. When problems develop though that are suggestive of a possible disease process such as postmenopausal bleeding the woman will be referred to gynaecology. Women are most usually seen in a clinic able to undertake ultrasound and hysteroscopy as an outpatient.

Menstrual problems,PRES097,C,A,A,"Too many periods, too few, too heavy, too scanty, too painful, too irregular; menstrual problems, unsurprisingly, are encountered frequently in primary care, given that they are common issues for half of the population of reproductive age. Increasingly, patients feel empowered to learn about their cycles, and speak to GPs and nurses about the symptoms that affect them, rather than just dismiss them as ‘women’s troubles’ or see them as something to be coped with. They may also be a factor in patients presenting for many other reasons, such as fatigue or palpitations secondary to anaemia, pain on intercourse, or worsening migraines. They are discussed in pill checks and during cervical screening, in conversations about fertility & the perimenopause, the 6 week postnatal check and more recently by patients who are considering vaccination for Covid-19. Become familiar with the questions needed to assess a patient’s menstrual cycle as part of a consultation, and the common pharmacological approaches to managing the symptoms and underlying conditions. Consider which patients should be managed in primary care, and who it may be appropriate to investigate further, with imaging, blood tests or a referral to Gynaecology. Discuss what symptoms would constitute ‘red flags’. Within your practices, speak to the practice nurses or GPs with an interest in women’s health.",Women with menstrual problems not responding to medical management in primary care or where malignancy is suspected are referred to secondary care of assessment to the gynaecology clinic. In the case of suspected malignancy this is likely to be a diagnostic clinic for ultrasound and hysteroscopy.

Mental capacity concerns,PRES098,C,B,A,"Concerns about mental capacity to make decisions occur in the short term, such as a person with pneumonia who becomes confused (can they refuse to go to hospital?), and the long term, such as in people with dementia (can they decide to live at home?). The legal principles are the same.
- The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) applies from the age of 16.
- People are assumed to have capacity, unless you show they lack it. You must do all you can to support them (e.g. using simple language and communication aids).
- Capacity is “decision-specific” (you can have capacity to decide about visitors but not to decide about a nephrectomy) and “time-specific” (if you don’t have capacity today, you might have it tomorrow); avoid labelling people as “lacking capacity” in general.
- To lack capacity, you must have “an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain” -- that is extremely broad, such as being intoxicated, having delirium, or being in the middle of a panic attack.
- The test of capacity is whether someone can (1) understand relevant information, (2) retain it long enough to decide, (3) weigh it up, and (4) communicate a decision. Sometimes it’s easy (e.g. unconsciousness). If it’s a finely balanced decision, the subtle point is usually #3 -- for example, a delusion of being persecuted by healthcare staff may affect someone’s ability to weigh up information about proposed treatments.
- A simple starting point is to explain options to someone, then ask them to explain back what you’ve told them in their own words.
- If someone lacks capacity, you must seek to act in their best interests, and to find out what those are.
- Some people may have a legal delegation of authority to another person, such as a Lasting Power of Attorney. However, in the UK, if the patient hasn’t delegated this authority, healthcare professionals must make health-related decisions -- families should usually be consulted, but don’t have decision-making authority.","Concerns about mental capacity are exceptionally common amongst inpatients; just think of all those coming into the Emergency Department with a reduced level of consciousness, and everyone who becomes confused as the result of pneumonia or cystitis. The MCA is the primary legislation covering these situations; it provides a broad and usually easy-to-use legal framework. All clinicians need to be familiar with its principles. If someone lacks capacity, the MCA can be used in the short term to prevent them leaving hospital and/or treat them, in their best interests. (Longer-term decisions have more extensive legal safeguards.) There is often overlap between the MCA and the Mental Health Act -- sometimes both can apply. In the context of mental disorder, someone may have capacity but that does not automatically mean that they are free to decide (e.g. if an alert patient attempts suicide and then seeks to discharge themself from hospital, they may have capacity but nevertheless be detainable under the Mental Health Act). When there is conflict between the patient’s wishes and the clinician’s perception of what is safe, these decisions can be very stressful. UK law, including common law, has always favoured those who seek to save life in emergency situations. Ask your liaison psychiatry service for advice in any of these situations if you are unsure.",No Paeds entry,"Concerns about mental capacity is a frequent issue on elderly care wards (see memory loss). However, it is important to remember that just because a patient has a diagnosis of dementia, they do not necessarily lack capacity for a specific decision.

Mouth problems,PRES099,C,B,B,"GPs regularly see dental problems if patients cannot access urgent dental care, however, we are not trained or protected medico-legally for this treatment. You are however, likely to see patients with symptoms and signs of mouth disease such as oral thrush, lichen planus, ulcerations and angular cheilitis. Consider the risk factors for oral cancer and be aware of how to assess the oral cavity for suspicious lesions and neck for lymphadenopathy. You may also see patients complaining of dry mouth - this is common in palliative care and with certain medications. Parents may also ask about issues such as tongue tie in infants at baby checks.","The mouth is the gateway to the aerodigestive tract and therefore as well as its essential roles in ingestion and digestion of food, it is also integral to respiration and speech. Mouth problems may therefore range from chronic dental or temporomandibular joint pain through to acute airway-threatening pathologies. The proximity of the mouth to other head and neck structures means oral pathology can be experienced as pain elsewhere (and vice versa) and may also spread directly to other critical areas (e.g. intracranial extension of dental infection).

You may encounter patients with primary mouth problems in surgical (especially ENT and maxillofacial) settings in both outpatients and inpatients, as well as emergency department presentations. Mouth problems are important in medical contexts - pain in the jaw may represent a myocardial infarction. Careful examination of intra-oral structures can provide valuable clues to underlying medical and surgical diseases, for example the oral leukoplakia which may reflect underlying HIV infection. Finally, the mouth is critical to airway management, meaning mouth problems are of key importance in anaesthetics. ", ,"Good mouth care is essential for older people.

Muscle Pain/Myalgia,PRES100,B,A,A,"Most people will experience muscle pain at some point- exertion, trauma and viral infections are common self-limiting causes and are often seen in primary care. Most cases will not need further investigation, and require simple advice and conservative management. Think about the questions you will ask a patient about the onset of the pain: Is it associated with pain elsewhere? Is there a particular distribution? Is there any associated weakness? Are there any other symptoms? Do you take any medications? Think about how you would examine a patient who complained of myalgia, and what would prompt further investigation, a trial of management such as steroids, or a referral. Speak to your tutors about their thresholds for tests such as ANAs, inflammatory markers and serological testing for infectious agents.","Patients with muscle pain/myalgia are most likely to be in neurology and rheumatology clinics, particularly where there are concerns about underlying primary muscle diseases. Inflammatory muscle diseases (myositis - with associated muscle stiffness) may be seen in both neurology and rheumatology. When severe this may be seen on general medical wards as well. Inflammatory muscle stiffness may also be due to polymyalgia rheumatica and patients with this will usually be referred to rheumatology clinics. Generalised/diffuse myalgic pain (due to fibromyalgic central pain amplification) may be seen in rheumatology and pain clinics, but may also be seen in many other clinics, since fibromyalgia is associated with multiple other symptoms. ","The most common cause of myalgia in children is viral infections, which are self-limiting and can be symptomatically managed with simple analgesia such as ibuprofen and paracetamol. Less commonly, neurological and rheumatological causes of muscle pain may present in children such as fibromyalgia, myositis and muscle abscess related to vaccinations, which is associated with a swelling or lump.","PMR is a common diagnosis of older people and commonly referred to general older peoples clinics as well as rheumatology due to their coexisting comorbidities. Peak incidence of PMR occurs between ages 70-80 with an increased prevalence in females.

Musculoskeletal deformities,PRES101,C,B,B,"Whilst patients may present to primary care with an acute deformity due to trauma (sometimes in the hope that they will be able to avoid attending A&E), the management i.e. referral to A&E/fracture clinic is fairly straightforward. More usually, patients will attend with more progressive deformities due to underlying conditions such as osteoarthritis, neurological disorders or in conditions such as Dupuytren’s contracture. You may also see patients with the sequelae of deformities following surgery or birth defects such as pain, skin breakdown and impaired function. Speak to the primary care team about provision of physiotherapy, podiatry, orthotic services and occupational therapy locally.","Musculoskeletal deformities are most frequently seen in orthopaedic clinics, since trauma/previous fracture is the most common cause of deformities. Acute deformities (due to fracture/trauma) will be seen in A&E and in orthopaedic fracture clinics. You will also encounter radiological assessment of musculoskeletal deformities in your radiology teaching sessions. Osteoarthritis can cause deformities of the joints and so osteoarthrotic deformities will be seen in orthopaedics and rheumatology clinics. Inflammatory joint pathology can also cause deformity (which current treatments endeavour to prevent). Deformities from conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis will be seen in rheumatology clinics but current treatment paradigms are fortunately making such deformities less common than was the case historically. Some of these patients, who do develop deformities, will be referred from rheumatology to orthopaedics for consideration of surgical correction. Neuromuscular disorders can also cause musculoskeletal deformities (for example upper motor neurone changes causing changes due to increased tone) and these patients may be seen in neurology clinics, in stroke clinics and in geriatrics. Musculoskeletal deformities can also be caused by underlying cancer or as a result of cancer treatments. These patients may be seen in your oncology placements as well in many general medical/surgical clinics.","The most common cause of musculoskeletal deformities in children are related to injury and trauma, and are commonly seen in accident and emergency or orthopaedics clinic. Other chronic causes of musculoskeletal injuries in children may be related to abnormal growth and development due to nutritional deficiencies, though rickets (Vit D deficiency) is now very rare. Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and rheumatological disorders such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis may also lead to deformities in children. ","A normal adult will have an angle of kyphosis of between 20-29% but in women aged between 76-80 years the mean angle of kyphosis increases to a mean of 52 degrees. As kyphosis angle increases physical performance and quality of life reduce. The consequences of severe kyphosis include falls, back and abdominal pains, pressure sores, reduced vital capacity, increased mortality and in women a 70% increased risk of future fractures.  Older patients with kyphoscoliosis will benefit from assessment by physiotherapists, occupational therapists and orthotics for back brace support and consideration of bone health assessment and management.

Nail abnormalities,PRES102,C,B,B,"It's common for patients to make contact about changes in the appearance of their nails. Think about questions you might ask, including exposure to topical substances, occupation and medical history. Examination of the nails should also be done when patients present with a number of symptoms such as breathlessness, joint swelling, or skin rashes. Discuss with your peers what you are looking for, and review images online to get a feel for how localised issues and common systemic conditions might appear. Be aware of benign and malignant nail tumours and the referral pathway. When are further investigations including nail clippings for fungal elements and blood tests useful? Be aware of treatment options, including self-care, for common conditions such as onychomycosis, paronychia, brittle nails and psoriasis","The nails are an essential structural component of the fingers. Therefore, as well as their appearance, a nail abnormality may significantly affect hand function and dexterity with significant impacts on daily life. As well as primary pathology affecting the nail (for example a fungal nail infection), abnormalities of the nail can provide clues to systemic pathology ranging from nutritional status (e.g. koilonychia and iron deficiency) to the splinter haemorrhages of infective endocarditis.
 
Patients with nail abnormalities may present to the emergency department (for example as nail trauma) or to outpatient clinics (for example dermatology). Nail abnormalities are also commonly identified in inpatients, particularly in medical specialties and the medical acute take, where abnormalities may provide essential clues to underlying disease.", ,"Age-related nail changes are very common. One of the biggest challenges for older people is to maintain nail health. It is essential when examining an older person to remove their socks and inspect the feet and toes, especially in patients who fall or who have diabetes. Hyperkeratosis is frequently seen, as is chronic fungal infection, affecting up to 50% of people over 70. Treatment is long; topical can be very challenging and oral medication has side effects and interactions. Therefore drug treatment is frequently not the goal, but podiatry is essential.

Nasal symptoms,PRES103,C,B,A,"You will see patients in primary care with nasal symptoms alongside other manifestations of viral upper respiratory tract infection, or allergies. Epistaxis is discussed separately. Speak to pharmacy about how patients may be managed initially. Sinusitis, whilst unpleasant, is more likely to be viral, though patients may request antibiotics early on (<10 days). Think about symptoms that may suggest a bacterial cause, and what information you would give a patient about the usual course; think about how to explain to patients that antibiotic treatment isn't always required and develop a shared plan. Be aware of red flag symptoms including intra/peri-orbital and intracranial complications of sinusitis, and symptoms of nasopharyngeal malignancy. Olfactory dysfunction is common, and following the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a lot more awareness of it. Think about the causes as conductive (physical obstruction, inflammation or congestion) or sensorineural (e.g. viral, neurological), and speak to your tutor about management including olfactory retraining.","Nasal symptoms present in a variety of ways in many inpatients and outpatient settings. Nasal symptoms have a wide range, and common ones are sneezing, itchy nose, nasal discharge, runny or blocked nose, smell disorders, epistaxis (nose bleeds) and postnasal discharge. Nasal symptoms are very common, and these can be part of primary nasal disorders, upper respiratory disease, or any other systemic illness. These symptoms can be acute and chronic. You can encounter them as acute symptoms in respiratory tract infections, commonly allergic rhinitis, acute sinusitis or viral illness in emergency departments and acute medical units. Mostly the chronic symptoms are presented in ENT clinics, like deflected nasal septum and nasal masses which can be tumors.  You can also come across multiple nasal symptoms as part of systemic diseases in neurology, neurosurgery, rheumatology or stroke units or clinics. For example, disorders of smell can be present in temporal lobe epilepsy, brain tumors or stroke patients; or CSF rhinorrhea in skull base fractures, or rhinophyma (nasal deformity).
Epistaxis is also a very common symptom which you can come across anywhere in the hospital, including acute presentation in the emergency department. Pt can have nose bleeds with severe uncontrolled blood pressure in any medical or surgical ward, or any patient on anticoagulant in cardiology, hematology, oncology, or general medical ward. Patients with thrombocytopenia can also present with epistaxis. In recent years, COVID-19 has also contributed to increase in different nasal symptoms along with epistaxis due to repeated nasal swabs, and these can be seen across different specialties.
So, whenever you come across nasal symptoms, you should keep your mind open that it can not necessarily part of primary nasal problem, it can be part of wider systemic illness. Proper history including the systemic inquiry and drug history will help in making the differential diagnosis and it can guide in the right direction for further management plan and referral to appropriate specialty. So, remember, all nasal symptoms are not for ENT referrals!","The most common nasal symptoms in paediatrics are related to infection of the upper respiratory tract and sinuses. Children can present with rhinorrhoea, blocked nose and associated symptoms of cough, fever and epistaxis. Epistaxis due to non-infectious causes is discussed as a separate topic. Alongside management of the infection, which is usually expectant, but can include anti-microbials, local treatment of the nasal symptoms with nasal saline flush, intranasal steroids or antihistamines might be indicated. Nasal polyps are extremely uncommon in paediatrics as are primary nasal malignancies. Occasionally children can present with a CSF leak via the endonasal route and underlying pathologies including base of skull trauma, infection or malignancy should be considered.

Neck lump,PRES104,C,B,B,"You will frequently identify neck lumps in patients, particularly children, when examining them for respiratory or throat symptoms. Examine for lymph nodes at every opportunity and be aware of what features would be concerning. Be aware of neck lumps caused by thyroid disease, and consider other signs that would be important to elicit. Which patients with lymphadenopathy or neck lumps would you do bloods in, and what would you do? Review the 2WW pathway locally and think about who you would 'watch and wait' and who you would assess more urgently for malignancy such as lymphoma.","Lumps, masses or swelling in the neck are common. These can present as single or multiple swellings in emergency departments, acute medical units, endocrine, ENT, rheumatology, haematology or infectious diseases clinics or wards. Neck lump can be enlarged lymph nodes, salivary glands, thyroid gland, or vascular masses. Sometimes they can arise from skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Enlarged lymph nodes are the most common neck lumps and they present in a variety of settings. They can present as part of acute viral infections like glandular fever in emergency departments. These can be seen as first presentation of haematological malignancies in haematology or oncology clinics/units. Other diseases which commonly present as neck lumps are HIV, SLE or sarcoidosis. Sometimes neck lumps also represent metastatic disease.  Enlarged thyroid gland is also encountered commonly. These are seen in endocrine and ENT clinics and wards. Lumps arising from skin and subcutaneous tissues can be skin tags, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, sebaceous cysts or abscess, and these ca be seen dermatology clinics. Very rarely neck lumps can arise from carotid artery like carotid body tumor or aneurysm, and these can be seen in vascular clinics.
Since neck lumps are very approachable, so they are often used as biopsy sites for diagnosis of underlying condition. So, these are also referred to interventional radiologist for aspiration biopsies or to the surgeons for excision biopsy.
So careful history and good clinical examination is the key in making the differential diagnosis of neck lumps, which helps in further investigations and referral to the right specialty.","Neck lumps are very common in children, and usually represent lymphadenopathy, which is discussed as a separate topic. Midline neck lumps are less frequent, but usually represent more significant pathology including thyroid, parathyroid abnormalities such as goitre, malignancy, infection. Also consider a thyroglossal cyst, which is an embryological remnant and can become infected. Perform a thorough history and examination and carefully consider the use of investigations such as bloods and imaging – ultrasound is usually a good initial investigation.

Neck pain,PRES105,B,A,A,"Estimated at affecting 1 person in every 2 in their lifetime, neck pain is responsible not only for a large number of consultations in primary care, but a significant loss of working days in the UK. Whilst musculoskeletal causes of neck pain are usually self-limiting, there is considerable overlay with psychological factors playing a role in the development or persistence of the symptom. Consider the options available when patients present- is there a direct access physiotherapy service? What do patients expect to be done for them? Which elements of the history and what symptoms would concern you, and what examination would you perform, including tests to identify cervical radiculopathy? Think about red flags for conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, meningitis, spinal fractures, carotid artery dissection or vertebral mets. Speak to your tutors about the role that imaging plays- who would they refer for an MRI? Review the guidelines for conservative management of mechanical neck pain and radiculopathy.","Neck pain (particularly chronic neck pain) overlaps significantly with chronic back pain/spinal pain. You will see therefore see patients with possible inflammatory neck pain (spondyloarthritis) in rheumatology outpatient clinics (both new and follow-up patients). Some patients with unresponsive or severe mechanical neck pain (particularly if it associated with upper limb pain, numbness or weakness) may also be seen in orthopaedic or neurosurgery clinics when surgery is being considered as an option. Acute severe neck pain will be seen in A&E, particularly in the context of trauma, where urgent assessment is required (see ABCDE of trauma) and urgent orthopaedic or neurosurgical assessment is required. Chronic mechanical post-traumatic neck pain (whiplash) will often be seen in pain clinics or in orthopaedic fracture clinics. Patients with possible metastatic disease involving the cervical spine (usually presenting with red flag symptoms of neck pain such as progressively worsening symptoms, night pain and systemic symptoms) may be seen during your oncology placements, on the general wards as well as in medical/surgical outpatient services (remember the common tumours that metastasize are breast, bronchus, kidney, thyroid and prostate).  Neck pain can also be caused by other structures in the neck - thyroid, lymph nodes, head/neck cancer, salivary glands, trachea etc - and so patients may also be seen with neck pain in ENT clinics, endocrinology clinics and haematology/oncology clinics","Neck pain is usually due to upper respiratory infections causing lymphadenopathy in children, which is usually self-limited. Other causes of neck pain may be neurological or rheumatological, which are usually associated with decreased range of movement or referred pain or sensory neuropathy affecting the upper limbs or back. Consider whether the pain is mechanical or neuropathic in origin. Practice a thorough neck examination including visual inspection and palpation and assess the patient’s swallow.","Neck pain is a common symptom in older patients. Low impact trauma (i.e. a fall from a standing height) may be enough to result in cervical vertebral fracture which carries up to 30% mortality. In addition, Osteoarthritis (cervical spondylitis) of the neck is a feature of normal ageing which lead to pain and reduced function. CPPD (calcium pyrophosphate disease) is one of the most common crystal-associated arthropathies in the elderly and should not be forgotton. A CT of the neck will demonstrate linear calcium deposits (crowned dens syndrome) and symptoms will respond to prednisolone.

Every year, over 90,000 babies are cared for in neonatal units in the UK, being directly admitted following birth or as a paediatric referral from the emergency department or primary care. On the neonatal intensive care unit, the biggest proportion would be babies born prematurely, requiring ventilation, parenteral nutrition and supporting normal homeostasis. These patients can stay for months on the unit, until their bodies are mature enough to support essential needs. The other part would be suspected sepsis and babies born with congenital anomalies, including cardiac, surgical or neurological as well as following asphyxia or meconium aspiration during labour.  In emergency settings the biggest proportion would be breathing difficulties (simple coughs and colds/bronchiolitis or episodes of holding breaths), feeding problems (such as vomiting, reflux symptoms and failure to thrive), constipations, jaundice and skin rashes. Sometimes symptoms are not very specific, such as irritability or lethargy, which require longer observations and, in some cases, additional investigations. Every neonate, presenting to emergency department should be considered having early or late onset sepsis and treated immediately. The additional emotional and practical support needs to be provided to parents, to empower and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to provide the best possible care to their babies. ","Neonatal problems may be encountered on maternity wards, in primary, secondary care or tertiary care. Common neonatal problems include crying and colic (PROB032), feeding problems (PROB080) and jaundice. Think about pathological causes of jaundice, how to recognize these and how to diagnose and treat jaundice. A wide range of congenital abnormalities can present in the neonatal period. The newborn screening programme, including physical examination, blood spot test and hearing screening is a key public health approach to diagnose these abnormalities early to minimise morbidity and mortality. Think about what specifically is examined for in the newborn screening and when to refer for further testing. Finally, sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among newborn infants, think about the risk factors for sepsis and how to assess these in your history taking and examination.", ,"(PH2) Inequalities - Children,Assisted Vaginal Delivery,Childhood development,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Fetal Hydrops,Fetal Hydrops,Fetal Hydrops,Year 5 seminar: Introduction to Neonatology,Year 5 seminar: Jaundice,Year 5 seminar: Murmurs and congenital heart disease,Year 5 seminar: Prematurity,Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare",12,Child health,,"Neonatal death or cot death,Prematurity",Child health

Pain - generalised,PRES107,B,B,A,"Widespread pain has a vast set of differential diagnoses at its onset, and it is extremely important to ascertain what other symptoms co-exist and observe how in order to rule in or out diagnoses such as Fibromyalgia (FM), which has no specific findings on examination or investigation. Patients presenting with generalised pain that persists longer than three months in primary care are often subject to a number of investigations and perhaps referrals into secondary care. Think about the value of ‘screening’ rheumatology tests versus early referral. Consider the abnormal physical and/or laboratory findings you might find in the inflammatory musculoskeletal or endocrine conditions to distinguish them from Fibromyalgia or CFS/ME. Speak to your tutors about how patients with Generalised Pain are managed in the community if no reversible cause is easily identified. What medications are frequently used, what is the evidence base for them, and what other resources are available?","Generalised pain is often seen in rheumatology and pain clinics, particularly when it is due to fibromyalgia. Generalised pain (due to fibromyalgic central pain amplification) may also be seen in many other clinics, since fibromyalgia is associated with multiple other symptoms. Generalised pain can also be seen in metastatic malignancy (either due to the metastases, hypercalcaemia or due to a paraneoplastic phenomenon) and so may be seen in oncology clinics and on the oncology wards. Generalised bone pain can be due to metabolic bone disorders (such as hypercalcaemia) and so may be seen in metabolic bone clinics, endocrinology clinics  and geriatric clinics. Polyarticular joint pain and muscle pain (see other presentations) can also present as an experience of generalised pain. ","Generalised pain in children may be a result of inability to localise pain, and a detailed history and examination may be able to focus the pain to a specific region. However, truly generalised pain in paediatrics may be related to muscle pain (myalgia secondary to infections, discussed separately) or joint pain as in juvenile idiopathic arthritis or similar. Also consider underlying systemic causes such as sepsis, malignancy or drugs as a cause of generalised pain in children.","Pain in the older patient is very common. It is important to investigate underlying causes and treat appropriately. Older people are more likely to have cognitive impairment which confounds pain assessment. They often have different types of pain simultaneously, increasing diagnostic uncertainty. Undiagnosed pain may present as delirium so in a confused patient, pain should always be considered. Please be aware of more potential side effects with analgesia in older patients but this may also lead to under-treatment of pain in the older population.

Pallor,PRES108,B,A,A,"A common worry for parents or carers, think about how you might assess a child or adult who ""looks pale"", either intermittently, or all the time. What diagnoses would you be concerned about? Think about the examination you would perform, and practice examining for lymph nodes and splenomegaly. Whilst performing a blood test may be considered reasonable and reassuring in most adults presenting with the same thing, speak to the tutor about how they might determine the appropriateness of doing a blood test in a child, given the distress it might cause. What would you test for in adults and children presenting in pallor, and with what urgency? Who would you refer immediately for assessment in secondary care?","Pallor is a common symptom for multiple medical conditions and so it is likely you will see multiple patients who have pallor as a symptom. Conditions which may present with pallor include anaemia, shocks/faints, hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, or albinism. However, it is also important to remember that pallor may be a racial or familial trait and hence may not indicate an underlying condition. Additionally, pallor may present in acute settings such as in pallor of limbs, which may indicate an underlying ischemia when found in association with other signs and symptoms of acute limb ischaemia. Pallor is a symptom seen in all levels of care, which should be considered within the bigger picture to allow accurate underlying diagnoses to be made. ", ,"pallor is frequently seen in older patients and often is a symptom of anaemia which needs a thorough work-up. In addition, many older people are less able to spend time outside and pallor may be a symptom of lack of sun exposure. In which case, think about bone health and Vitamin D, calcium and PTH levels.","Anemia,Anemia,Anemia,Assessment of a child under 5 with fever in primary care,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,""Recorded teaching session - GI exam, Liz Goode"",Shock,Shock,Shock,""Slide deck - GI Exam, V Mulcahy"",Year 4 Vascular teaching session",11,Medicine,,"""Cold, painful, pale, pulseless leg/foot"",Pallor","Cardiovascular,Child health,Clinical haematology"
Palpitations,PRES109,B,A,A,"Patients may present with palpitations as their primary symptom, but it is important to elicit in most scenarios, when patients present with anxiety, breathlessness, chest pain, abnormal sweating, and weight loss to name a few. It is a common presentation, and worthy of a case based discussion or tutorial if you have not seen a patient with palpitations. Whilst the cause is usually benign, it is important to not miss a potentially life-threatening arrythmia. What approach should you take in primary care to a patient experiencing palpitations at the time of evaluation? Do you have access to an immediate ECG? In patients who are not currently symptomatic, consider what characteristics of the palpitations are important, and what might prompt immediate referral. Think about the questions you should ask the patient, and the importance of noting medication and any substance misuse. What examination would you perform? Be aware of the use of technology such as smart watches, and devices such as AliveCor for detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Which blood tests? Look up the referral pathways for direct access echocardiograms and ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring, and ask to see some reports. Who should be referred and what is the current wait time for a cardiology referral locally? How might you safety net in the meantime?","Palpitations are a common, non-specific complaint of patients presenting to emergency departments, and cardiologists. In a study reporting the etiologies of palpitations, 43% were found to be of cardiac etiology, 31% had psychiatric causes, and the rest were classified as miscellaneous. Anxiety-related palpitations are most commonly seen. However, a study noted that upto 67% of patients diagnosed with a mental health condition had underlying arrhythmia.

It is important to get proper history from the patient regarding the arrhythmia, as well as details of past illness, medications, social behavior, and family history. This should be followed by a complete physical exam including vital signs (with orthostatic vital signs), cardiac auscultation, lung auscultation and examination of extremities. A 12-lead electrocardiogram must be performed on every patient complaining of palpitations, to prevent misdiagnosis. A complete and detailed history, along with the findings of the physical examination can help you get closer to the most likely explanation.

Laboratory studies should be used to further evaluate and identify patients at high risk for an arrhythmia. Aggressive diagnostic approaches can include ambulatory monitoring or electrophysiological studies for such high risk patients, enabling data collection during palpitations more-likely. Management of this condition is determined by the underlying cause.","Cardiac causes of palpitations are less common in children than anxiety, but it is important to exclude serious causes such as arrhythmias including supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which is the commonest cardiac cause of palpitations in children. A thorough history including family history is very important, followed by appropriate investigations such as ECG or holter monitor. An acute episode of SVT is an emergency and you should know the immediate management, which would include Valsalva in compliant patients, or adenosine. Panic/anxiety is separately discussed.","Palpitations in older people are more likely to reflect serious underlying cardiac arrhythmia, in particular, atrial fibrillation. Extra-systoles are more common in older people and occasional extra beats may also be described as palpitations- remember to take a clear history, ensuring you understand exactly what your patient means by a palpitation. Other causes to consider include electrolyte disturbance, fever, thyroid abnormalities and anxiety. Some medications may also lead to palpitations, such as salbutamol, anti-psychotics, and thyroxine. Withdrawal of beta-blockers may cause palpitations.","British Thoracic Society/SIGN British Guideline on the Management of Asthma,Cambridge University Health Partners field overview video - Pulmonary embolism - James Garvey,Management of dysrhythmias,Cardiovascular and Peripheral Vascular examinations,""Challis BG, Powlson AS, Casey RT, et al.

Panic/anxiety,PRES110,A,A,A,"Patients commonly present in primary care with panic attacks and/or anxiety. Clinicians dealing with such patients must consider whether the underlying reason is a physical or psychiatric disorder. A number of disorders are recognised within the umbrella term of anxiety disorders. These include, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), social phobia, specific phobias (example spiders) and acute stress disorder.
Around 25% of the population will experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives. Women are twice as likely to suffer from anxiety disorder compared to men. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common anxiety disorder. It comes on gradually and can begin across the life cycle, however, the risk is highest between childhood and middle age. GAD is characterized by excessive, persistent, generalized anxiety, not restricted to a particular event or activity. Individuals may constantly worry about work, finances or health of family members. There may be motor tension (restlessness, fidgeting, tension headaches), inability to relax and autonomic overactivity that can occur most days for at least several weeks or months. Take a detailed history and attempt to identify which anxiety disorder is present (see flowchart, psychiatry learning resources ), ensuring the presentation is not due to a physical disorder such as myocardial Infarction, cardiac rhythm disorders, hypertensive crises, metabolic disorder/thyrotoxicosis, severe infection or misuse of substances.  ","The majority of patients with anxiety disorders are managed in primary care. Treatment resistant and complex cases are referred to specialist mental health services. Many patients already in psychiatric or general medical secondary care may also experience emergence of panic/anxiety symptoms or one of the anxiety disorders in addition to their primary mental or physical health disorder. Comorbidity of anxiety disorders with other psychiatric disorders is common, particularly with depression and substance misuse. Panic/anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder may emerge in medical or surgical settings, thus complicating the clinical picture and negatively impacting morbidity and mortality. It is essential that physicians and surgeons are able to recognize this, appropriately use their communication skills training and experience to take this into account, and seek appropriate support from liaison psychiatrist or psychology colleagues where appropriate.
Panic/anxiety or anxiety disorders commonly present in Emergency Departments, where the symptoms are sometimes mistakenly attributed (by the patient and/or doctor) to some physical problem, for example complaints about the heart or breathing difficulties.", ,Anxiety has a reported prevalence rate of between 38-72% of patients with dementia and is often an over-looked symptom in patients with cognitive impairment. Anxiety may be a symptom of cognitive impairment in the early stages and anxiety as a presenting symptom should provoke further cognitive assessment.

Pelvic mass,PRES111,C,A,A,"You may see a patient presenting having noticed a mass in their pelvis, but more commonly patients will describe swelling, or a sensation of heaviness or dragging, or urinary symptoms. A mass may be found when a patient is examined during cervical screening/STI testing or a intrauterine device fitting. Look up the role of Ca125 testing in primary care and the associated sensitivity and specificity, and the referral pathway for a pelvic mass. How might you manage suspect acute or chronic retention of urine? What about in palliative care patients? Don't forget pregnancy as a possible cause, and speak to the midwife or safeguarding lead about management of a concealed or denied pregnancy.","The symptoms associated with pelvic masses include pain, fullness, pressure, bloating, changes to urinary or bowel habit, decrease in appetite or early satiety and menstrual cycle abnormalities. Patients may however be asymptomatic and the masses only discovered incidentally on imaging. Pelvic masses may originate from the bowel, bladder or gynaecological organs (ovaries, cervix, uterus or uterine adnexa).

Woman will most commonly present with symptoms associated with pelvic masses and will be seen in gynaecology outpatient clinics, in theatre and as inpatients on the gynaecology ward. Often the nature of a pelvic mass cannot be confirmed before an operation is carried out and the tissue removed and sent for histology. The differential diagnosis is broad, and the age group of the patient is significant in determining the most likely pathology. Pre-menopausal younger women are more likely to be affected by outflow tract obstruction, ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, fibroids, ectopic pregnancy and endometriosis. Post-menopausal women are at increased risk of gynaecological cancer. Pelvic masses, such as fibroids, can be complicating factors during pregnancy and will also require closer follow-up in antenatal clinics.

Urinary retention, constipation, kidney transplant, bladder calculus, diverticular disease, bladder and colon cancers are amongst other potential differential diagnoses for a pelvic mass.", ,"Urinary retention (whether painless or not) may present as a pelvic mass and is easily treated! Also, constipation frequently presents as a left sided pelvic mass. Ovarian cysts and pelvic malignancies are also seen in elderly care.

Pelvic pain,PRES112,C,A,A,"Patients may report acute pelvic pain but more commonly describe abdominal pain. Be aware of how emergencies present, including ectopic pregnancies, pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian torsion, appendicitis and urinary tract disease. How are patients triaged in your surgery? How is safety netting provided whilst patients await an appointment or phone call with a doctor? Given the multiple organ systems that may cause pelvic pain,  think about how you will begin to identify a possible cause. Speak to your tutor about characteristics of gynae and intra-abdominal causes of pain and initial investigation and management options within primary care. Who will you refer patients to? Chronic pelvic pain is common, impacting 1 in 6 of adult females, and maybe associated with many conditions including endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis and fibromyalgia. As such, you may see patients with pelvic pain in consultations for a variety of problems including menstrual problems, dyspareunia, urinary symptoms, or during contraception clinics or cervical screening.  The cause, and therefore, treatment is multifactorial, so your assessment and identification of the patients concern is important. Depression and anxiety are common comorbid conditions. Think about the questions you will ask, what you are looking for on examination, and what investigations including bloods and imaging may be appropriate.","Pelvic pain, like abdominal pain more generally is a common presenting symptom and without any other information has a wide differential. Detailed history and examination are crucial to teasing out information and using SOCRATES (Site, Onset, Character, Radiation, Associated symptoms, Timing, Exacerbating and relieving factors, Severity) or a similar system helps to fully qualify the pain. Especially for chronic pain try to establish any patterns, such as an association with menstruation and associated symptoms. It is important to rule out acute conditions which may require surgical intervention (appendicitis, ovarian torsion) and in young children and confused patients remember that testicular pain and be referred into the abdomen/pelvis. This presenting complaint needs to explore potentially sensitive topics (menstruation, sexual partners and STI testing, history pregnancy and miscarriages or terminations) and potentially intimate examination.

Penile symptoms,PRES113,C,B,B,"Patients may present with a variety of symptoms that affect the penis, that are distinct from sexual problems such as premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction (see presentations list). These may be bleeding, discharge, pain, dysuria, ulceration or masses. Think about questions that might help you differentiate the causes and what examination and further investigations you may consider. Be aware of who should be referred to the GU services, Urologists or Dermatology.
 Balanitis/balanoposthitis is a common presentation in children- be aware of safeguarding issues. Another common reason for consultation is phimosis in children. This is usually physiological, but consider what symptoms and signs would be pathological and prompt treatment or a referral. Think about what would constitute an emergency and what findings would require a 2WW","Penile symptoms are common but could be infrequently reported by patients unless it is overwhelmingly a concern or specific questions are asked about them. This may be attributed to the global awareness that men often under-report ill-health to protect self-image and masculinity.
These symptoms could be anatomical or functional. Anatomical symptoms may be external (rash, lumps, ulcers, pruritus, redness, oedema, narrowed preputial orifice or traumatic injury) or internal (urethral discharge, preputial deposits, vesicles, meatal ulcers, warts or fibrotic lumps). Functional symptoms are related to sexual or urinary dysfunction and include erectile dysfunction, premature or retarded ejaculation, loss of libido, dysuria and haematuria.
Patients with penile symptoms may be encountered in both medical and surgical placements in outpatient and inpatient settings. Medical specialties like Infectious diseases (via the sexual health and HIV clinics), Rheumatology (outpatient clinics- patients with Reiter’s syndrome, Bechet’s syndrome) and Dermatology offer good clinical experiences with urogenital symptoms. Urology is the main surgical specialty where patients with similar symptoms are seen, in an outpatient or inpatient (often emergencies- paraphimosis or priapism) setting.
Clinical encounters involving assessment of the genitourinary system are sensitive and can be embarrassing for the parties involved i.e., student and patient. Therefore, it is important to approach such interactions with this in mind, ensuring patient’s privacy, comfort and the presence of a chaperone.", ,"Penile symptoms seen on the Geriatric wards include paraphimosis, which typically occurs after catheter placement. It is important to ensure the retracted foreskin is returned to its normal position after placing a catheter. Penile and scrotal oedema may be seen in right heart failure, particularly if a patient has been nursed with elevated legs so the most dependent part of the body is the pelvic area.","Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Gastrointestinal examinations,Genitourinary Medicine in the Community,Year 5 -- Specialist Medicine - TYAC & Communication Skills ",4,GP,,Urethral discharge and genital ulcers/warts,"Infection,Obstetrics and gynaecology,Sexual health"
Perianal symptoms,PRES114,B,A,A,"Whilst perianal symptoms such as itch, or pain are often due to localised issues such as perianal abscesses, fissures and haemorrhoids, symptoms such as bleeding, skin changes/masses or fecal incontinence may be a sign of an underlying serious or systemic condition. Consider questions that you may ask, acknowledging that some patients may find it difficult to speak about these topics and thus delay presentation or initially consult about something unrelated.  Think about scenarios in which it is important to screen for perianal symptoms, such as postnatal checks, sexual health discussions and consultations about back pain and changes in bowel habit.  Become familiar with what you are looking for when you examine the perianal region and do a digital rectal exam. Understand the common causes of perianal symptoms in children and how to manage them, taking into account safeguarding issues. Be aware of signs that would prompt urgent referrals to the surgical team or a 2 week wait. Speak to the clinical team about treatment options for common conditions such as haemorrhoids, and what patients can change in terms of diet/fluid intake or buy over the counter to alleviate symptoms.","Perianal symptoms are a group of conditions that affect the rectum, the anus and the skin surrounding the anus. They can be broadly grouped into four categories: itch, pain, lumps and bleeding. Patients with perianal symptoms, and in particular bleeding, commonly present to the emergency department and surgical assessment unit.
This group of symptoms will be encountered in a range of presentations from anal or rectal cancer to haemorrhoids or rectal prolapse. Patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease commonly present with rectal bleeding and perianal lesions including fistulas, abscesses and scarring. When admitted to the hospital, these patients are usually seen on general surgical wards under the colorectal team or on gastroenterology wards under medicine. They will also have review and follow up in outpatient settings including via the two-week wait pathway for lower GI tract cancers.
Itching, lumps, skin growths, warts, blisters and sores around the genitals or anus are features of sexually transmitted infections and these perianal symptoms would most commonly be seen in the sexual health clinic.", ,"Moisture lesions in the perianal area are common in patients with either urinary or faecal incontinence, and a thorough examination in patients reporting these symptoms is essential. In addition, a patient presenting with poor self-care due to cognitive impairment is also likely to have poor peri-anal skin care and this area should be examined in all older patients presenting in this manner.","Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Gastrointestinal examinations,Genitourinary Medicine in the Community",3,GP,,Perianal symptoms,"Gastrointestinal including liver,General practice and primary healthcare"
Perioperative care,PRES115,B,A,A,"Perioperative care begins when patients are booked for surgery until their discharge post operatively. Patients are usually referred to the surgeons, acutely or otherwise, for assessment by the primary care team. Look up the referral criteria locally for common non-urgent operations such as hernia repairs, tonsillectomies. You may witness the interface between the two in the form of communication from the pre-operative clinic when a patient is identified to have elevated blood pressure, or need medication (such as anticoagulation) reviewing before a procedure. Patients often come to speak to their GP, an important provider of continuity with the advantage of a holistic understanding of their history, for reassurance before a procedure. Think about how GPs, the majority of whom have limited surgical experience, may provide support in shared decision making. Review surgical discharge summaries, speak to the practice nurses about wound care, and think about the role of the primary care team after surgery. How are immediately post-operative patients, who may be at risk of complications such as infection, bowel obstruction, venous thrombo-embolism and wound dehiscence, flagged up within the practice?","A job of a Foundation Year Doctor on a surgical placement is the management of the perioperative care of a patient, the care provided to patients before and just after surgery. Surgery puts a large amount of stress on the body, with complications being fairly common. Having a good system of categorising these complications based on the timeframe and type of surgery the patient has undergone is key in identifying and managing them, allowing for an uneventful recovery for patients.","Children may require surgery for a variety of reasons, elective or urgent, and pre and post operative care forms a critical part of their care. When assessing a child for elective surgery, e.g. for tonsillectomy, consider whether they have active respiratory infections that can affect anaesthesia/ventilation, coagulopathy for any reason or other reasons for not proceeding with surgery. Post-operatively, wound care, minimisation of infections of the wound and systemic or respiratory infections is vital. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered and close follow up and monitoring with the surgical team including wound/tissue nurses should be ensured.","It is increasing recognised that there is a need for older people undergoing surgery to have joint care with a geriatrician and the surgical team. Pre-op and peri-op comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimisation reduces post-op complications and 'POPS' clinics (Peri-Operative care for Peri-older People undergoing Surgery) are now common-place in most hospitals.

Peripheral oedema and ankle swelling,PRES116,A,A,A,"A very common reason for patients to consult with their GP, you may also identify peripheral oedema and ankle swelling when seeing patients for medication or hypertension reviews, or with symptoms of breathlessness, abdominal swelling, or limb pain.  Understanding the mechanism of oedema- due to increased plasma volume, venous obstruction, vasodilation, hypoalbuminemia, increased permeability of capillaries, and lymphatic obstruction is key. How would you assess an adult or child presenting acutely with peripheral oedema- what questions are important, what examination would you perform, and what would you assess for on urinalysis and on bloods. Look up the local (and European) guidelines for echocardiography following a BNP. Speak to your tutor about how you would assess for venous thrombo-embolism and what scoring systems and tests are available within primary care- what is the local referral pathway? What red flags may suggest a malignancy, such as an ovarian mass? Would you treat patients with a diuretic to offload fluid whilst awaiting further results? Speak to the district nurses and GPs about management of oedema and skin care in patients who are end of life.","Peripheral oedema being a nonspecific and common finding among a wide variety of diseases puts clinicians in a dilemma. Causes can be anything from benign to potentially life threatening, hence requiring a prompt and logical approach to the condition. When peripheral oedema is untreated, it can increase the risk of infection and ulcers.

Differential diagnosis of peripheral oedema includes CHF, portal vein congestion, nephrotic syndrome, venous insufficiency, DVTs, lymphedema, myxedema, angioedema and urticaria, cellulitis, lipedema, obstructive sleep apnea, and medication-induced oedema. In an in-patient setting, detailed history and a detailed physical exam can help immensely to differentiate between systemic causes such as CHF, liver disease, renal failure, and thyroid disease. Initial efforts in the workup should focus on excluding these major systemic causes, and tests should be performed according to the suspected cause. Treatment should be guided by the underlying condition that predisposes to the formation of oedema.

Peripheral oedema may be a warning sign, and if not treated early leads to high morbidity and mortality. It is also necessary to educate your patients regarding healthy lifestyle, and prevention of long-term complications.", ,Amlopdine is frequently prescribed to older patients and a common side-effect of this drug is peripheral oedema. Right heart failure is another common of bilateral peripheral oedema. Key points for looking after older patients with peripheral oedema are to consider how the oedema affects their mobility and whether they are at risk for falls; consider their skin care (is the oedematous skin at risk of breakdown? - involve district nurses early); consider underlying arterial supply before compression bandaging (ABPIs).,"03 Chronic liver disorders - video,04 Biliary liver disorders - slides,Arthritis,Arthritis,Arthritis,Cardiovascular and Peripheral Vascular examinations,Case Based Geriatrics,Chronic Kidney Disease - Ruth Silverton,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Essentials of Geriatric Medicine Introduction lecture,Gastrointestinal examinations,""Haematology 1, 2 & 3"",""Haematology 1, 2 & 3"",""Haematology 1, 2 & 3"",Heart Failure,Peripheral Oedema,Peripheral Oedema,Peripheral Oedema,Renal Pharmacology (Diuretics),Renal Replacement Therapy - Ruth Silverton,Respiratory examinations,Prescribing snapshot - Heart Failure: prescribing IV furosemide ",22,Medicine,,"Painful swollen leg,Peripheral oedema and ankle swelling","Cancer,Cardiovascular,Infection,Obstetrics and gynaecology,General practice and primary healthcare,Child health,Medicine of older adult,Renal and urology"
Personality disorder,PRES117,C,A,A,"Personality Disorders are characterized by maladaptive, deeply ingrained and enduring behaviour patterns, manifesting themselves as inflexible responses to a broad range of personal and social situations, which are frequently (but not always) associated with subjective distress and impaired social functioning.
Assessing and diagnosis of personality disorder is complex: it requires taking of comprehensive history, particularly, longitudinal history, exploring of pervasive nature of problems/symptoms, along with standard psychiatric history and mental state examination. Diagnosis is usually made in those over 18 years old, but can be made earlier by experts. Taking of collateral history is essential and it also helps to pay attention to control over impulses and manner of relating to stress.
Many individuals presenting in primary care for a host of reasons have personality disorder that influences their presentation. They are often described as difficult and not formally diagnosed. GPs (and other health professionals) often find it difficult to manage patients with personality disorder, in part because there are no quick-fix treatments, and there are no evidence based prescribing options. For those who are diagnosed by specialist services, particularly those with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder (Borderline type, also known as borderline personality disorder), GPs often rely on support from specialist mental health services such as Crisis teams. GPs involvement often means being a point of contact when patients present in crisis, prescribing of medications that have been advised by specialist services, and considering how a patient’s personality disorder may be relevant for their physical and/or mental health comorbities.","Access to secondary care for individuals with personality disorders is often through the Emergency departments where the person often presents either as threatening suicide or having attempted suicide often in form of having taken an overdose. Physicians or surgeons may manage the patient on general hospital wards for complications of self-harm (eg medical complications of overdose, or surgical treatment after self-harm by jumping, cutting or ingestion of damaging foreign bodies).
Some individuals with PD are managed by crisis teams in the community, however, when the risk increases, short-term admissions to general psychiatric wards may be arranged. Some NHS Trusts have specialised teams, often known as Complex treatment teams, who manage individuals with severe personality disorders (generally in long-term basis). Unfortunately stigma is wide-spread against individuals with diagnosis of personality disorder, which does not help effective management of these individuals. Personality change in adulthood is different, and may result from an underlying psychiatric or medical disorder.

Poisoning,PRES118,B,B,A,"Patients may contact their GP immediately, or sometime after an episode of deliberate self-poisoning- see Deliberate Self Harm to think more about approaching this in primary care. Consider nonintentional ingestion of substances in young children presenting with unexplained symptoms, and also abuse in adults and children. Be aware of symptoms and physical findings that may suggest poisoning with common substances such as iron, SSRIs, opioids, anticholinergics and hallucinogens. Speak to your GP tutor about their use of TOXBASE - poisons information database for clinical toxicology advice and which patients are referred to A&E. Find out how sick patients with possible poisoning are assessed and managed in you practice prior to admission via ambulance.","Poisoning is the attendant clinical manifestation due to exposure to any form of poison, a harmful substance that can kill, injure, or impair normal physiologic function in humans. Poisoning indicates that the toxic exposure is unintentional, for example, a child who inadvertently ingests washing products. The terms poisoning and overdose may be used interchangeably, particularly when prescription drugs are the offending agents. However, it is important to note that overdose indicates intentional toxic exposure either in the form of a suicide attempt or as unintentional harm in the setting of drug abuse. Poisoning has a bimodal distribution occurring in children between the ages of 1 and 5 years and the elderly.
These patients often present with multisystemic symptoms in isolation or as symptom complexes or toxidromes that give clues to the unidentified poison. An example is an elderly patient with tricyclic antidepressant poisoning that presents with coma, seizures, widened QRS complex or evidence of dysrhythmia on ECG, and dilated pupils. These patients are often seen in the emergency department or acute medical unit, where they present with seizures, coma, cardiac arrhythmia, and metabolic disturbance. Some delayed manifestations of poisoning are hepatic, renal, respiratory, and hematologic manifestations.","Accidental poisoning is common in curious children, but non-accidental poisoning should always be considered and safeguarding triggered if appropriate. Poisons can include prescription medications for the child or adult in the household, as well as non-prescription medications or substances such as cleaning products, bleach and other household substances. Prevention education is important for parents/guardians, including locking dangerous poisons and medications out of reach of children. Acute management of children suspected to have ingested or inhaled poisons should always include seeking assistance from the National Poisons Information Service and/or Toxbase. In some cases drug levels can be monitored to check for clearance and other poisons have specific toxicities to monitor for such as cardiac or gastrointestinal toxicities.","Accidental poisoning may be seen in older patients with cognitive impairment particularly in those with polypharmacy who are still managing their own medications. The use of dosette boxes helps to reduce to risk of accidential overdose. If possible, encourage older people to bring all their medication to clinic (not just the prescription sheet) so medication may be thoroughly reviewed. It is quite common for patients to have 2 different brands of the same drug (one prescribed on discharge from the hospital, and one prescribed from their GP) and for the patient to assume they are different. This can lead to double dosing and consequent accidental poisoning eg Diltiazem might be Adizem and  Tildiem.","Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Global Oncology teaching session",2,Emergency medicine,,Poisoning,"Acute and emergency,Child health"
"Pregnancy, including antenatal care and termination",PRES119,B,A,A,"Antenatal care may be started via self-referral or through GPs, midwives, community centres or hostels, and before a booking appointment, patients are offered early pregnancy health and wellbeing information. GP surgeries often vary in how this initial contact is managed and by whom; speak to your primary care team about how pregnant patients are managed, and the team’s interaction with the community midwifery services. Consider the GPs role in identifying pre-existing health or social concerns that may impact on how a pregnant patient is managed in order to reduce the risk of worse outcomes associated with issues such as chronic disease and deprivation. GPs are often responsible for assessing people with common problems during pregnancy (such as nausea & vomiting, heartburn, vaginal discharge and pelvic girdle pain), and may be the first point of contact for symptoms such as vaginal bleeding and reduced foetal movement. Remember that patients may also need support for pre-existing or acute conditions, such as respiratory infections or depression that may have nothing to do with their pregnancy, but that management of these may have to be adjusted as a result. Speak to the team about local and national resources they may use for guidance.
People who are considering termination of a pregnancy are encouraged to self-refer to services but may ask to be referred by the GP to the pregnancy advisory service for discussion and counselling. Be aware of the role of the GP in supporting this process, and not delaying access because of personal beliefs. Consider how patients may be supported following a termination, including for fetal abnormalities, in terms of physical and psychological sequelae. Be aware of the need they may have for ongoing care from the primary care team including community midwives and counselling services, provision of contraception if desired, or referrals for genetic counselling and early assessment in subsequent pregnancies.","The pregnancy advisory service will arrange ultrasound for estimating the pregnancy gestation and then offer a full discussion of the options to support the woman in her decision regarding pregnancy continuance or termination. Surgical and medical management can be offered. Some women opt later for termination of pregnancy following a problem being recognised in the pregnancy - for example if a fetal abnormality is identified on ultrasound or after screening tests. . These women will usually attend the delivery unit for the medical management of the termination.
Community midwives provide antenatal care for low risk women in pregnancy. This takes place in community teams or clinics. An assessment of factors in the woman's history if taken at booking, and if needed there will be a referral made to see an obstetrician in a hospital antenatal clinic. Some women with risk factors may then receive all their antenatal care in the hospital setting, for example women with diabetes. Antenatal clinics will be run by a multi-professional team for example in this case a specialist midwife, obstetrician, diabetic physician, dietician and specialist nurses. Ultrasound scans are also performed in the antenatal period for high risk women. Other women may be referred to a hospital clinic for assessment, but then able to continue with community care - for example a woman with a previous postpartum haemorrhage - she may attend clinic with an obstetrician, have a delivery plan made, but then continue with the normal low risk pathway for her antenatal care. When you see pregnant women at the hospital think about their risk factors - whether they existed before pregnancy or have arisen during it, and the range of professionals involved in their care.

Pregnancy/labour,PRES120,B,A,A,"Throughout the UK, the majority of women in labour will be managed by midwives or the obstetrics team. Whilst UK GPs will now rarely be called upon to deliver a baby (unlike in the 1960s when ‘Obstetrics in General Practice’ was a popular handbook produced by the BMA), there are some more rural or remote areas such as NHS Shetland where GPs with special interest in obstetrics provide medical care within a maternity unit. For all GPs, having an understanding of the signs and symptoms of labour at any stage within a pregnancy is important, as is an awareness of the local maternity services and referral routes. It would seem reasonable for all primary care teams to being prepared for the eventuality of an unexpected delivery given that pregnant patients often attend surgeries. Speak to your tutor about the information that is received in primary care about the nature of a delivery, and how they begin to address and provide support and follow up for what is a significant physical and psychological experience for their patients.","There are three places where women give birth - home, a midwife led birth centre or an obstetric led delivery unit. Women chosing to give birth at home tend to low risk, and are supported by the community midwives. They recommend transfer into hospital should a problem arise. You will be able to see women labouring in the hospital. The midwife led birth centre is for low risk women. Doctors are not involved with the care of women, but will attend when called for advice or in an emergency situation. The midwives provide assessment, labour care, conduct the delivery, provide postnatal care for mother and baby and discharge them home. Women with risk factors such as preivous obstetric problems (e.g. Caesarean), current obstetric problems (e.g. a growth restricted baby) or medical problems (e.g. diabetes) will come to the obstetric led delivery unit.

Pregnancy/postnatal care,PRES121,B,A,A,"Speak to the primary care team about the role they take in post-natal care, and see if there is an opportunity for you witness six week checks, or speak to patients who have recently had a baby. Talk to the midwives if possible about the purpose of the first postnatal contact in the community after delivery. Consider how to assess a woman during any postnatal contact, including physical examination of the perineum or abdomen where appropriate, and think about how you might address topics such as postnatal mental health problems, contraception and physical problems such as incontinence, hypertension and mastitis. Be aware of red flags that might indicate sepsis, retained placental tissue, venous thromboembolism or pre-eclampsia. Understand the importance of communication between healthcare professionals at the point of handover (such as following up blood pressure or haemoglobin issues, low mood, or concerns about substance misuse or domestic abuse) and also how to address local inequalities such as deprivation and language barriers that may have an impact on outcome for the baby and mother. Remember that parents who have experienced a late termination, still birth or neonatal death will also require follow up,and speak to the GP about how this is managed. ","If birth is striaghtforward, mother and baby are discharged home the same day. A longer stay may be indicated for maternal concerns - for example an obstetric problem (postpartum heamorrhage, Caesarean) , a medical problem (preeclampsia, a woman with cardiac or renal disease) or becuase additional monitoring is needed for the baby  - due to breathing problems, need for intravenous antibiotics, to establish feeding. The midwives provide the postnatal care on the ward supported by the obstetric and neonatal doctors. Midwifery care assistants and nursery nurses  provide invaluable support to mothers with breastfeeding. Women with more complex problems may be initially cared for on an obstetric high dependency unit  - this would most usually be due to preeclampisa, major obstetric haemorrgahe, sepsis or underlying medical disorders.

Premature/delayed Puberty,PRES122,C,B,B,"A common concern for parents and young people is early, or late establishment of puberty. You may identify this during consultations about mood changes, heavy bleeding or contraception. What examination is appropriate? Hormonal testing can be difficult to interpret, so consider carefully who should have which bloods, and ideally involve the endocrine team early- speak to your GP tutor about the use of advice & guidance, or consultant advice lines. The RCPCH guidelines remind us that a brain tumour should be considered in all cases of delayed, arrested or precocious puberty- what other symptoms should you ask about?","Premature puberty on the other hand means an abnormally early onset of puberty and secondary sexual characteristics in children, that is before the age of 8 in girls and 9 in boys.
Premature puberty is also known as precocious puberty and is classified into two major categories based on aetiology, Central precocious puberty (CPP), GnRH dependent and Peripheral precocious puberty (PPP), GnRH independent. CPP represents a true pubertal development due to earlier maturation and activation of the HPG axis. Some common causes include CNS tumours or injuries which may require the attention of a paediatric neurologist or neurosurgeon. Others are genetic mutations, syndromes such as neurofibromatosis type 1, internationally adopted children, and familial precocious puberty.  PPP involves the development of secondary sexual characteristics without pulsatile GnRH secretion. Here, sex steroids may be produced from endogenous or exogenous sources. Some of the causes include congenital adrenal hyperplasia, McCune-Albright syndrome, gonadal tumours, adrenal tumours, and exogenous exposure to sex steroids. Initially, females present with breast development and males with increased testicular volume (more than 4ml). Many of these patients initially present to general paediatric or paediatric endocrinology clinics. When evaluating patients with early puberty, It is important to think about whether this pubertal development is occurring before the normal age of onset or not in evaluating these patients.
Delayed puberty is defined clinically as the absence of the first signs of puberty in girls by the age of 13 and boys by the age of 14. Delayed signs of puberty include the absence of breast and testicular development. However, most patients are cued to seek medical attention due to delayed growth rather than slow pubertal development. The most common cause of delayed puberty is a functional delay in the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), therefore, you may see many of these patients during your pediatric or endocrinology rotations. Other causes include individual genetic variations known as constitutional delay of poverty (CDGP) and functional defects such as undernutrition or chronic illness, you are likely to see these patients in the general paediatrics clinic or pediatric emergency where they may present acutely. A thorough history and examination, which includes anthropometric measures and nutritional status, are important in reaching a diagnosis.","It is important to understand the timing and chronology of normal pubertal development. Patients with abnormal pubertal development, either early or late, often present in primary care and will commonly be referred to secondary care after some initial investigations. Think about how to examine pubertal development and what red flags to look out for in history and examination that may indicate and underlying pathological cause.", ,"Amenorrhea,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Paediatrics - Puberty & Growth",3,Child health,,Pubertal development,"Child health,Endocrine and metabolic"
Pruritis,PRES123,B,B,A,"A common presentation that occurs in skin conditions and as a feature of systemic disease. Be aware of the common conditions that occur more in certain populations such as older adults, menopausal patients, pregnant people and children. What questions would you are ask a patient presenting with pruritis? Think about patterns of dermatological disease and what you would look for on examination- remember skin findings may be subtle. Consider signs of systemic disease you would look for including liver disease, malignancies, thyrotoxicosis and infection. Speak to your tutor about what bloods would be appropriate, and in whom you might do investigations such as HIV testing and Hepatitis serology, imaging or serum protein electrophoresis. Discuss general skin care that you would advise whilst investigating pruritus further, and how you might manage a patient where there is no clear cause. Be aware of over the counter and primary care treatments for common conditions such as eczema, tinea, xerosis, lichen sclerosus, threadworms and urticaria.","Pruritus means itchy skin. It is a common dermatological symptom that can be quite distressing for patients. Occasionally, it may be the only presenting symptom recognised by the presence of scratch marks on the skin, however, there are often other associated symptoms that are revealed during consultation.
Pruritus may be generalised or localised to one body region and it may also be acute or chronic. Understanding the distribution pattern and duration of onset can be helpful to unravelling the underlying disease aetiology. Localised pruritus is often due to primary dermatological diseases while generalised pruritus often reflects a systemic disease. In some cases, localised pruritus may be a reflection of an underlying systemic disease (e.g., itchy folliculitis of HIV infection).
Patients with pruritus are more likely to be encountered during your medicine blocks (inpatients and outpatient settings), although some surgical specialties offer good experience as well. This is the case with the hepatobiliary medical and surgical placements where there’s a huge focus on pruritus assessments. Other specialties with good ward and/or clinic experience of patients with pruritus include Dermatology (Atopic dermatitis, Psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, urticaria), Infectious diseases (scabies, HIV infection, superficial fungal infections, tinea cruris, onchocerciasis), Rheumatology (dermatomyositis, scleroderma, Sjogren syndrome), Neurology (multiple sclerosis, postherpetic neuralgia), Haematology (Iron deficiency, polycythaemia), and Renal medicine (chronic kidney disease). During the psychiatry placement, you may encounter patients with delusional infestation, psychogenic excoriation both of which manifest with severe and sometimes debilitating pruritus.","Children can present with generalised itchiness as a manifestation of urticaria, atopy (eczema) or very rarely systemic illnesses including liver disease. Localised pruritis may be associated with contact dermatitis, skin infection or localised eczema. Take a thorough history of the duration of symptoms, contact with allergens, past or family history of atopy and carefully examine the skin for erythema, dryness and systemic signs of illness. Antihistamines might be helpful for systemic urticaria, while topical barrier creams, steroids and dressings are best management for eczema depending on the severity. Look up the NICE guidelines for the diagnosis and management of eczema and advice you would give parents.","A very common presenting complaint in older patients. The most common cause of pruritis is dry skin as a result of physiological ageing, though the differential is very wide. It can have a significant effect on the quality of life and should be taken seriously. Most older patients benefit from twice daily emollient to improve the integrity of their skin and reduce subsequent pruritis.","Dermatology: A Handbook for Medical Students and Junior Doctors (3rd Edition),British Association of Dermatologists,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Dermatology examinations,Dermatology revision session,DermNet,I Spy Dermatology,Skin Deep,Skin of Colour in Dermatology Education,The Primary Care Dermatology Society,Year 4 introduction to Dermatology",11,GP,,Pruritus,"Dermatology,Gastrointestinal including liver,Obstetrics and gynaecology"
Psychosis/thought disorder,PRES124,C,A,A,"Psychosis refers to a state of losing contact with reality, experience as ideas (delusions) or perceptions (hallucinations) not anchored with external stimuli. Thought disorder consists in difficulties on sustaining a coherent discourse (sometimes referred to as disorganised speech), and is sometimes referred to as a psychotic symptom. Both psychosis and thought disorder can be seen in primary care, mostly as a complaint by families and careers rather than because of seek-helping, although mild psychotic symptoms can present in primary care. Psychosis can be caused by psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders, including pharmacological, illegal and legal substances triggers (including withdrawal), stress and neurological and endocrinological conditions. It is important to evaluate whether it is an acute or chronic phenomena, there is a clear trigger, level of insight and coexisting phenomena (e.g. delirium, dementia, abnormal movements).","People can be brought to A&E by family, paramedics and police, as people suffering with psychosis act according to their distorted perceived reality. Thought disorder is seen in A&E in people with psychosis. The clinical presentation with disorganized speech can be similar to some aphasias caused by a stroke - in young patients this difference is rarely a challenging differential due to associated symptoms and risk factors that make the diagnosis clear. Psychosis and thought disorders can be seen in neurology clinics (e.g. epilepsy, dementia, movement disorder, brain tumours), and are commonly seen in intensive care, and from time to time on other wards. Psychosis is the core presentation of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and is commonly seen in other mental health problems, such as mania or severe depression.", ,"Thought disoders are commonly seen in older people and elderly patients are at an increased risk of developing psychotic symptoms. A delirium is a form of thought-disorder and the prevalence of delirium is reported as between 10-40% on medical wards; higher still in nursing homes. A combination of physical illness, social isolation, sensory deficits (hearing and visual loss) cognitive changes and polypharmacy all add to the vulnerability for psychosis.

Rectal bleeding,PRES127,B,A,A,"The most common symptom of haemorrhoids is rectal bleeding, and haemorrhoids are very common. Consider how you might approach a patient, with previously known haemorrhoids, in their mid-50s, now presenting with rectal bleeding? Look up the 2WW referral pathway locally, and think about your assessment. Rectal bleeding is important to specifically ask about when seeing patients with symptoms such as change in bowel habit, weight loss or pain, as some may be too embarrassed to mention it, or think it is ""just haemorrhoids"". What other symptoms are suggestive of malignancy or inflammation? What characteristics suggest an anal fissure or tear? Be aware of the causes of traveller's diarrhoea and how you might investigate and manage symptoms.

In particular, look up causes of rectal bleeding in infants including intussusception, and never forget to consider abuse.","Rectal bleeding is a very common symptom of patients presenting to the general surgical service, particularly in A&E. You will also encounter patients with rectal bleeding in general medicine, paediatrics and even urology. Bleeding from the rectum can be an emergency with massive haemorrhaging and hemodynamic instability, or it could involve small amounts of blood. Any form of lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding needs to be investigated, but taking a thorough history from your patient will help with determining the cause of the bleed. Common causes of rectal bleeding include haemorrhoids, anal fissure, colorectal cancer, but can also include ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease, and diverticular disease. These would be typically seen during your general surgery placement. During your paediatric rotation in year 5, you may see rectal bleeding in patients with intussusception. Proctitis can also cause rectal bleeding, something you could see during your urology or sexual health placement. ", ,"It is essential to establish both the volume lost and the duration of the bleed. Consider whether the patient is on anti-platelets or anticoagulation. If the patient is cardiovascularly comprised then reversal of the anti-coagulation may be important. In older patients on warfarin, consider if they may have had recent medication which has led to a very high INR (such a course of antibiotics). The INR must always be checked in patients presenting with a rectal bleed and all patients should a DRE to look for possible causes such as haemorrhoids, or an rectal mass. Diverticular disease, angiodysplasia and malignancy are commonly seen in the older population.

Rectal prolapse,PRES128,B,B,A,"Due to embarrassment, patients may be reluctant to report a mass that protrudes through the anus, and you may discover this when asking about bowel symptoms or abdominal discomfort, or even on examination. Think about differential diagnoses and red flags. Speak to your tutor about how to support patients with a rectal prolapse awaiting surgery, or those in whom surgery in not appropriate.","Rectal prolapse refers to the abnormal protrusion of tissue past the anal margin. This can happen in one of two ways:
1) In a type 1 or mucosal prolapse there is the protrusion of redundant mucosa out of the anus. The deeper layers of the rectum are left in their normal place. This is more common in children, and especially in children with cystic fibrosis.
2) In a Type 2 or complete/full thickness prolapse all layers of the rectum have folded down to protrude from the anus. This is the more common prolapse, especially in older populations, and especially in older women with more complicated obstetric histories.
Prolapses present as a protruding mass which may return to its original position spontaneously or may require manual reduction i.e. pushing back in. It may be associated with incontinence. Over the longer term, there may be oedema, ulceration, and resultant pain or bleeding. Investigation involves a sigmoidoscopy, and potentially measurement of anal tone by manometry. Treatment is either conservative, for example with pelvic floor exercises and stool softeners to prevent straining, or surgical.
This condition is most likely to be seen in colorectal surgery clinics on a surgical placement. It may also appear in GP practices or on the acute take if it is a first presentation.",No Paeds entry,"Permanent rectal prolapse would typically be referred directly to the Surgeons.

Reduced foetal movement,PRES056,C,A,A,"Whilst very few UK GPs are involved in monitoring patients in labour using intermittent auscultation or CTGs, they have a role in being able to identify and educate patients about signs of distress such as reduced foetal movements. GPs will need to be aware of referral pathways for pregnant patients locally and how quickly action should be taken so that women are getting correct and consistent advice about how to present to maternity services.","Reduced fetal movements can be an important sign of a problem. It is usual for women to start to feel a baby move between 18-22 weeks. As babies grow the movements become more frequent and obvious until about 32 weeks after which time they stay more or less the same. Babies will have phases of sleep and tend not to move during this time - but sleep rarely lasts more than 90 minutes.
Any woman over 24 weeks who is concerned about a reduction of change in the movement pattern of her baby should seek advice from a maternity professional. after 28 weeks it is advised that this assessment occurs promptly in a maternity hospital to allow a thorough assessment of the wellbeing of the baby.", , ,"Assisted Vaginal Delivery,""Caesarean, VBAC and Induction of Labour"",Clinic - Ultrasound in pregnancy,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Early Pregnancy Problems,Obstetric examination,Gastrointestinal examinations,RCOG Guidance,Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare,Learning guide - ultrasound department",10,Obstetrics & Gynaecology (O&G),,Reduced/change in fetal movements,Obstetrics and gynaecology
Runny nose/sore throat,PRES129,A,A,A,"You will be hard pushed to avoid common symptoms like these during primary care placements, and in your own life! Perhaps the most important question to ask yourself is, why is this patient consulting at this time? Consider what self-care advice is available to the public (and the evidence base), and who they may contact about these often self-limiting symptoms. How does the surgery triage and manage these patients? Has the pandemic altered this? Ask your GP tutor what has been the impact on prescribing behaviour of managing conditions like this remotely. What tools do they use to assess an acute sore throat and what factors make a bacterial cause of sinusitis more likely? Look up the local microbiology guidance for antibiotic use.  Which red flags do you need to be aware of that might prompt an urgent referral blood test or admission, and which patients would you consider referring to secondary care? Be aware of general advice and reassurance you can give and resources that you can signpost patients and their parents to following a consultation.","Runny nose and sore throat are very common and many patients can present to A&E with these symptoms, particularly in the colder months. They can be seen in all age groups, particularly the paediatric and geriatric populations. These are non-specific but typically are seen with the common cold, influenza, and Covid 19. A sore throat, or pharyngitis, can be seen in secondary care in allergy clinics, but you may also see patients with a sore throat presenting in sexual health (such as HIV or gonorrhoea), ENT (e.g., laryngitis), and during your infectious disease placement (e.g., diphtheria). It can also It can be an innocuous symptom, or a sign of something more potentially serious (e.g., meningococcal disease). As always, taking a thorough history on your patient can help you rule in or rule out differentials. ",It is normal for young children to have up to 8 or more colds per year. Many will present with runny noses and sore throats to primary or secondary care. It is important to be able to distinguish viral causes from more serious infections such as peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess. When would you consider Kawasaki disease as a possible differential diagnosis? Examination can often provide the answer as to what is causing the sore throat. Try to build up experience in ENT examination in children.

Scarring,PRES130,A,A,A,"Scarring following trauma, inflammation, surgery, or burns may be encountered in nursing clinics when assessing wounds, during post-natal assessments, when seeing patients with dermatological conditions such as acne, or in encounters with patients who deliberately self-harm. Be aware of the importance of considering self-harm, abuse or female genital mutilation and know how to refer and support these patients appropriately. Think too about the consequences of internal scarring/adhesions and how this may present in patients who have had surgery or inflammation such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease or inflammatory bowel disease.","Indications for referral to secondary care, such as dermatology or plastic surgery, include functional deficits caused by contractures or those scars which are causing cosmetic concern. The impact of scarring on a patient’s life, livelihood and wellbeing are all factors to consider. In some cases, conservative management with skin camouflage (make-up) is sufficient to manage the scarring, however further options include silicone gels, local steroid treatment. In some cases, surgery may be considered. However, just like any surgical procedure, the consenting process should always include the potential impact of the new scar, which could be irregular and unsightly, and rarely, worse than the original.

Half of testicular cancers present in patients under the age of 35, and may initially appear as hydrocele, epididymo-orchitis or testicular pain- not just as painless swellings- so think about how you would investigate and follow up a patient. What are referral criteria and conservative measures for inguinal/femoral hernias?","Acute presentation of scrotal swelling represents a possible surgical (incarcerated inguino-scrotal hernia) or urological (testicular torsion) emergency. Distinguishing features from less urgent diagnoses include assessment duration, acuity of onset and the presence/severity of pain, and if concerned, specialist input should be sought. While less likely to require surgical intervention, infective or traumatic diagnoses are also part of the differential.

 

  In the outpatient clinic, while malignancy may be the primary concern, there are indeed other benign presentations, where anatomical and embryological knowledge is key. Consider previous testicular swellings, family history as well as clinical exam findings to help narrow down the differential.","Take a careful history and examine the area of swelling, considering differential diagnoses including hernia and testicular pathology. Infections are the commonest cause of scrotal swelling, including orchiditis, epididymitis. Also consider other non-infectious aetiology such as hydrocoele, testicular torsion (which is an emergency) and malignancy (testicular or metastatic from other sites such as leukemic deposit). Trauma is another common cause of scrotal pain/swelling in boys, hence a thorough history is important.","Patients with inguinal masses are seen in Geriatric Clinics and on the wards, particularly when the patient is frail and may not be suitable for surgery. It is important to exclude malignancy. In benign causes, the risk-benefit of invasive treatment should be evaluated and if surgery for a hernia is not an option, then patients should be referred to physiotherapy for a truss.","Analgesia and NSAIDs,Analgesics lecture,Chronic Pain lecture,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Gastrointestinal examinations,Oncology extension teaching resources,Uropathology,Uropathology,Uropathology,Week 4 - Analgesia and Oxygen",10,Surgery,,"Acute and chronic pain management,Scrotal/testicular pain and/or lump/swelling","Acute and emergency,Cancer,Neurosciences,Obstetrics and gynaecology,Palliative and end of life care,General practice and primary healthcare,Perioperative medicine and anaesthesia,Child health,Renal and urology,Surgery"
Sexual problems,PRES132,C,B,B,"WHO define sexual health as “…a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.” (WHO, 2006a) Whilst presentations of overtly sexual health matters, such as sexually transmitted infection, dyspareunia or erectile dysfunction, are encountered frequently within primary care, it is important to identify the impact that many conditions will have on an individual’s sexual health. You may see this discussed in reviews for diabetes, menopause, mental health or COPD and heart disease, or during cervical screening clinics and in post-natal checks. Consider the impact of culture and social norms on how comfortable people, especially minority groups, feel when discussing sexuality with health care workers. Talk to the practice team about how they address this and maintain awareness of their own perceptions of what constitutes good sexual health. ","Elements of the sexual cycle – namely excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution may be impacted by various sexual problems, preventing an individual or a couple from achieving sexual fulfilment. This issue is reported to affect up to 43% of females and 31% of males to some degree. Sexual problems include a vast array of presentations, in women this may include low libido, negative thinking during sexual intercourse, problematic or absent orgasms, or vaginal atrophy (thinning, drying and inflammation of the vaginal walls) leading to painful intercourse. Men may present with erectile dysfunction, prolonged or painful erections or orgasm/ejaculation disorders. Sexual problems may be due to a physiological, psychological, or social trigger.
   In such patients presenting with sexual problems will be seen across different healthcare settings and may be encountered on inpatient wards or in outpatient departments. For instance, it is entirely plausible that sexual problems may manifest from urological infections/malignancies, chronic conditions (such as diabetes, cardiovascular pathology, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia or renal failure), additionally from problems relating to hormonal deficiencies (oestrogen / testosterone), substance misuse (including illicit / recreational drug-taking and excessive alcohol consumption) or demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorders and brain and spinal cord injuries. Therefore, these patients will be seen in specialities such as Urology, Gynaecology, Endocrinology, Cardiology, Nephrology, Psychiatry, Neurology and Rehabilitation settings. Often these patients may feel ashamed to speak about their difficulties openly, and therefore exploration of the full bio-psycho-social aspects in any history-taking, in a compassionate and empathetic manner is imperative. ",No Paeds entry,"Many medications can result in an unwanted side effect of impotence; autonomic failure (commonly seen in diabetes, and Parkinson's disease) may also result in sexual dysfunction. It is important to be open and accepting of older people's sexual needs and be willing to discuss this as it is increasingly commonplace in outpatient consultations. Normal ageing is associated with general decline in physiological sexual response but recent studies suggest that older people continue to be sexually active. Viagra is a common cause of syncope in older male adults and may not be evident on the repeat prescription as it can be bought over the counter. Sexual problems in older women is less well documented with a dearth of published medical literature.

Skin lesion,PRES162,A,A,A,"People may develop many different skin lesions throughout their lifetimes, and commonly present to primary care to seek reassurance that they are not cancerous or infective. Most benign skin lesions, such as seborrheic keratoses or dermatofibromas are diagnosed based on clinical appearance (morphology, distribution) and history. The increased access to camera phones and technology-enabled communication platforms (such as Accurx) mean that photos can be shared between patients and clinicians and be used in discussions/referrals to secondary care colleagues. Speak to your practice team about how skin lesions are triaged. Do the community pharmacists have a role in assessment? Do any of the GPs at your practice use a dermatoscope? Whilst on placement, look at as many skin lesions as you can, and practice describing them to your tutor and colleagues. Think about the features that might be suggestive of skin cancer or an underlying malignancy or infection such as HIV and speak to your tutor about the different referral options. Some surgeries offer minor surgery such as excisions, punch biopsies and cryotherapy- ask about thresholds for treatment and the role of Exceptional Funding agreements. Consider how to manage expectations for patients who want removal/treatment of lesions such as skin tags or molluscum contagiosum.","Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK and can present as a new or changing skin lesion i.e. an area that is different from surrounding skin such as a new lump, spot, ulcer or mole that the patient hasn't noticed before or a non-healing sore or mark in the skin ( including moles) that has changed size, shape, colour or texture. These lesions may sometimes be described as itchy, painful or bleeding.
Patients may present concerned about a skin lesion or the lesion maybe picked up incidentally by a healthcare professional during a general examination. Think about how you would approach a patient with a skin lesion; taking an accurate history , performing a thorough examination and applying clinical reasoning skills will help guide your management plan. Whilst most skin lesions are benign it is important to recognise an atypical or concerning lesion and refer promptly via a 2 week wait , the Non-pigmented, solitary lesion pathway or Tele-dermatology so that the patient can be assessed by a Dermatologist and the lesion examined or photographed with dermoscopy.

Benign skin tumours are very common, student doctors should be aware of the following benign lesions: seborrheic keratosis, dermatofibroma, neurofibroma, epidermoid and pilar cysts, keratoacanthoma, haemangioma, and viral wart. Can you describe the features of pre-malignant skin lesions such as actinic keratosis (solar keratosis) and intra-epithelial carcinoma (Bowen's disease)? Non-melanoma skin cancers are by far the commonest form of skin cancer, Basal cell carcinomas account for almost 75%, whilst SCCs are less common, they have the potential to metastasise and therefore must be referred on a cancer pathway.  Consider how you tell the difference and discuss the treatment modalities for pre-malignant versus malignant skin cancers, are you familiar with surgical techniques such as skin biopsy and excision and can you explain to patients the risks and benefits of surgery?  You should be able to describe different types of benign melanocytic naevi and recognise the features of malignant melanoma including the different sub-types. It is important to be aware of the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant pigmented lesions and the red flags which should prompt referral.

When a patient presents with a skin lump, obtaining a clear history about its growth and associated symptoms such as itch and pain is important. Next, a thorough examination which includes appearance and nature on palpation.
Once one excludes lumps not arising in the skin (e.g. underlying enlarged lymph nodes), one way to divide up the lumps is to first consider whether they present with any surface change i.e. epidermal involvement, or whether they are purely subcutaneous with normal skin overlaying them. If the latter, the list to consider includes:
- Lipomas (benign tumours of adipocytes)
- Ganglions (cystuic swellings related to synovial structures such as tendons – often ion the dorsum of the and or foot)
- Dermoid cysts (epidermal lined cysts deep to the skin)
- Fibromas – benign tumours of fibroblasts
If there is surface involvement, consider its nature. Is it reddening and inflammation with pain? Scaling? Or discolouration? If the former, consider whether this is an infection, for example an underlying abscess. If there is scaling present, consider papillomas (layers of skin overgrowing a central vascular core) or ketato-acanthomas. If there is discolouration but not clear inflammation or scaling, other options include:
- Sebaceous custs
- Sebborheic keratoses
- Dermatofibromas
- Neurofibromas
- Pyogenic granulomas
- Keloid scars
- Melanomas

Skin ulcers,PRES135,B,B,A,"Skin ulcers that are secondary to infection or trauma, are common, particularly in the mouth and genital area. Patients will generally present with painful ulcers, but you may notice painless ulcers when examining for other reasons. Think about how to what questions to ask patients, and who should be referred onwards to services such as GUM. How do community teams identify those patients at risk of pressure ulcers, and work to prevent them? Speak to the practice and district nursing team about assessment and management of ulcers, including venous and diabetic foot ulcers. What examination and investigations might you undertake to identify underlying peripheral vascular disease? Consider how to address the pain, infection, bleeding, exudate and psychological impact of malignant ulceration.","Skin ulcers describe any lesion involving full thickness skin loss, and naturally, will be a common finding you encounter. With many different types and causes of skin ulcers, it will be more useful to learn how to describe skin lesions, in particular their location, size, and appearance; this will also be relevant for examinations and OSCEs.

Being able to identify specific features will help form differential diagnoses. For instance, a circular punched-out ulcer on the pressure areas of a patients’ foot may point you towards a diabetic foot ulcers; very prevalent, given the large number of diabetic patients in all specialties. Similarly a painful well defined ulcer of the lower legs surrounded by cool shiny skin may point to an arterial ulcer, rather than venous ulcer which may be more shallow, and have more exudate and irregular margins.

Finally it is also important to link these findings to the wider clinical picture. For example with signs of diabetes or peripheral vascular disease. Beyond these common ulcers, in a gastrointestinal specialty setting, histories of inflammatory bowel disease may point towards erythema nodosum skin ulcers.",No Paeds entry,"The underlying cause of an ulcer should be determined i.e. venous, arterial, neuropathic. Involve the tissue viability team early to help with chronic management; district nurses may also be heavily involved. Skin ulcers in the elderly significantly impair quality of life due to immobilty, pain and social stigma. When assessing an older patient for the first time, it is important to document the presence of pressure ulcers and the nurses would typically complete a Waterlow score to assess ongoing risk.

Sleep problems,PRES136,C,B,A,"Sleep is an important cornerstone of health, and poor quality sleep/unrefreshing sleep, lack of sleep or disrupted sleep due to other physical symptoms is often discussed within a consultation, either as the primary focus, or as part of a number of symptoms and chronic conditions including conditions such as ME/CFS. Primary insomnia is the diagnosis in only a small percentage of cases presenting to primary care with difficulty sleeping. As such, careful history taking is important, taking into account physical and psychological problems, use of stimulants and medication, the impact of work and external stimuli. Addressing sleep related issues is rarely a 'quick fix'- speak to the GP tutors about how they manage patients with sleep disorders. What further exploration is necessary (e.g. sleep diaries), and what physical assessments might be considered? Be aware of questionnaires such as STOP-BANG that may help you identify sleep apnoea, or IPSS for urinary symptoms that disrupt sleep. Discuss the topic of benzodiazepines and Z drugs with your tutors and the alternative strategies available in the region such as access to CBTi (cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia). How can you manage expectations of patients who want sleeping tablets? What self-help strategies are you aware of that can be offered to patients? Be aware of common sleep issues for children, including parasomnias, and also the impact of ageing on the sleep cycle.","Sleep problems may be referred to specialist sleep clinics, particularly where there is a suspicion of specific sleep pathologies such as obstructive sleep apnoea. You may see these patients during your Royal Papworth placements since this is where the regional sleep clinic is based. However, these patients may also be seen in endocrinology clinics (due to obesity and associated diabetes) and in respiratory clinics (since there may be additional disordered breathing). Patients with sleep problems are also seen in rheumatology clinics (since sleep problems are a frequent contributor to fibromyalgic pain) and in neurology clinics (since neurological disorders can cause disruption of central sleep regulation). Sleep problems can also be a symptom of underlying mental health problems (anxiety disorders, psychosis, depression etc) so you may encounter patients describing sleep problems during your psychiatry experiences. ",Sleep problems in children can affect their behaviour and school performance. How would you assess disordered sleeping in children? What advise can you give patients and their parents regarding healthy sleep hygiene? Some children may require further evaluation via polysomnography such as children with neuromuscular disorders or with suspected obstructive sleep apnoea.   ,"Sleep problems are also seen in Geriatric Clinics. Sleep disturbances are a common complaint in patients with dementia but also due to age related changes affecting the circadian rhythm, co-morbid illnesses, and medication (causing a side effect of drowsiness). Environmental factors lead to sleep disturbance particularly in institutions (hospitals and nursing homes). Lack of daytime activity due to immobility and co-morbid conditions, often leads to daytime somnolence with a reversal of diurnal activity. It is also important to consider the impact of significant sleep disturbance on the carer and whether family members (particularly older spouses) may need support themselves.","(HB6) Addictions,Confusion and Dementia,Confusion and Dementia,Confusion and Dementia,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Movement Disorders,Movement Disorders,Movement Disorders,MSK introduction to diagnostic reasoning,Neuroscience and Mental Health:  Common Psychiatric Problems in Primary Care,NICE Guidance on Myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy)/chronic fatigue syndrome: diagnosis and management,Parkinson's Disease in older adults,Tiredness and fatigue,Tiredness and fatigue,Tiredness and fatigue,Multidisciplinary: Neuroscience and Mental Health:  The Mental Health Act and Ethics",16,GP,,Sleep problems,"Mental health,Neurosciences,General practice and primary healthcare"
Small for gestational age/large for gestational age,PRES137,C,B,B,"Most UK pregnancies are managed by midwives in the community or within a maternity unit, however, there are places in the UK (such as NHS Shetland) where GPs take on the role of an obstetrician in monitoring pregnancies. All GPs interact with pregnant patients for a multitude of reasons, and an ability to assess foetal growth and wellbeing, as well as maternal health, is therefore, important as a consultation may be a valuable opportunity to identify a potential problem. Speak to your GP tutor about how pregnant patients are managed locally, and the referral pathways they use if they have any concerns. Consider the role of the primary care team in working with midwives to identify which patients may be at risk of Intrauterine Growth Restriction or Macrosomia early in their pregnancy.","Women with a baby thought to be small or large for dates will be referred for ultrasound scan at the maternity unit. If the growth is normal they are returned to continue low risk care under the community midwife. If a problem is recognised they transfer under the care of an obstetricain and are followed up in antenatal clinics with additional scans being performed as required. Some women have risk factors for a small baby (previous small baby, renal disease) or a large baby (diabetes) or need scan assessment as use of a clinic measurement may be inaccurate (women with fibroids or high BMI) and they will be offered additional scans routinely. ",Children born small for gestational age may require admission to a special care baby unit or even neonatal intensive care if they are also born prematurely. These children are at increased risk of complications in the perinatal period including hypothermia and hypoglycaemia. About 15% of children born small for gestational age do not catch-up in height and you may see then in Paediatrics for review of short stature.

Speak to the tutor about referral pathways for eye symptoms locally and consider how you might explain squints to patients. ","Children with squint are typically referred to ophthalmology by paediatrics, general practice or optometrists. It is important to identify children with squint since this can interfere with visual development in the squinting eye (leading to amblyopia) or be a presentation of underlying ocular or neurological conditions.

Stridor,PRES140,B,A,A,"Patients, or their carers, may describe noisy breathing, or you may identify stridor during remote assessment of a patient with shortness of breath, on examination, or from the waiting room. As acute onset stridor may be life threatening, identify how patients with any airway symptoms are triaged in your GP practice and assessed. Be aware of common causes such as croup, foreign body, bacterial tracheitis and allergy, epiglottis due to HiB, and their initial treatment.","Stridor describes the high-pitched breathing sounds associated with irregular airflow in the airways. Given that stridor is a sign of airway disorder, it should prompt you to think about protecting the airway, the first step in an A to E assessment.

Stridor is often thought of as an important paediatric sign, with croup (laryngotracheobronchitis caused often by viruses such as influenza and parainfluenza), and foreign body aspiration being common differentials in infants. However many other conditions can affect the airways and should also be considered. Infectious causes of airway disturbance include peritonsillar abscesses, epiglottitis (commonly caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus), or bacterial tracheitis. Alternatively anaphylaxis secondary to an allergic reaction can be considered.

For all these differentials, it is useful to think of associated signs during history taking and examination to narrow them down. For instance, in addition to the age of the patient, you could consider spotting for rashes or hives in an allergic reaction, the characteristic barking cough in croup, or the drooling and “thumb-print sign” on lateral c-spine x-ray in epiglottitis. It is also useful to note that in epiglottitis, a lot of care must be taken for the airway, by avoiding any manipulation which may cause airway spasm.", ,"From a Geriatric perspective, sudden onset stridor (after managing it acutely) should always prompt a swallow assessment, particularly in a patient with cognitive impairment.

Substance abuse/dependence,PRES142,B,A,A,"Patients may present to GPs with alcohol or substance abuse and dependence, or it may become apparent when consulting for other problems. Try to distinguish between harmful use and dependence. Screening tools (like the CAGE questionnaire) are just a starting point - once misuse is established it is essential to ask about dependence symptoms such as cravings, withdrawal symptoms, relief of withdrawal symptoms by the substance, reinstatement after abstinence, primacy of drink/drug seeing behaviour, and how disabling the condition is in terms of disrupting work, education or relationships. Patients can then refer themselves, or be referred by GPs, to alcohol or substance misuse services. In England, most alcohol or substance misuse services have been contracted out to third sector or private healthcare organizations, free of charge to patients at the point of use, but delivered by non NHS employees. Patients may come to the attention of police when intoxicated, and then may need to be assessed by a police surgeon. ","Physicians and surgeons will encounter the complications of substance misuse on the wards or in clinics, and alcohol can adversely affect every organ system. Junior doctors may be the first to notice delirium tremens or other symptoms of withdrawal in a patient admitted for elective surgery. Accidents secondary to intoxication frequently lead to emergency department attendance. Assessment of physical and mental health of a patient is challenging when the patient is intoxicated, so after basic emergency treatment is administered, it may be necessary to wait until intoxication resolves before further clinical assessment. As alcohol and drug use can cause or be caused by mental illness, psychiatrists will commonly encounter patients with these problems. Secondary psychiatric services will rarely provide a specific service for alcohol or substance misuse, but will be familiar with so-called “dual diagnosis patients”, who for example may have schizophrenia and comorbid cannabis (or other substance) dependence.", ,"It is still important to take a detailed alcohol and recreational drug history from an older person. Patients who are not labelled as alcoholics may still be drinking way above the recommended weekly total and if this is not recognised, can lead to problems with withdrawal if they are admitted. Older people tend not to talk about their drinking habits and may mistake the effects of alcohol as a physical or mental health problem. Addiction/dependence on opiates and benzodiazepines is also a recognised problem in older adults.","(HB6) Addictions,Alcohol Case Based Discussion,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Forensic Psychiatry,Liaison Psychiatry,Neuroscience and Mental Health:  Common Psychiatric Problems in Primary Care,Psychiatric Emergencies,Substance misuse,""Handbook of clinical psychopharmacology

Sudden infant death syndrome,PRES143,C,B,A,"Whilst SIDS is defined as an unexplained death, there are some strategies that reduce the risk. During encounters with expectant parents, or with very young infants, you may find the opportunity to discuss these- speak to your tutor, or the community midwives about the advice given to parents. You may meet families who have lost a child in this way- look up local and national support services for grieving parents, and speak to clinicians about their involvement with cases and the follow up that happens in the community.","Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of infant death beyond the neonatal period. It has a UK incidence of approximately 1 in 2000 infants. Its peak incidence is between the ages of one and three months although SIDS can sometimes occur up to the age of twelve months. Often termed “cot death”, SIDS is defined as the sudden, unexpected, and unexplained death of an apparently healthy baby. Risk factors for SIDS include exposure to tobacco smoke (antenatally and postnatally); prone and side sleeping; bed sharing during sleep; a sleep environment that includes soft mattress and/or sleeping surface; placement of soft sleep bedding; over-bundling; over-heating; prematurity; exposure to alcohol and illicit drugs (antenatally and postnatally); and viral infection. Protective factors include the use of a dummy during sleep; immunisation; and breastfeeding.

Children who are found with SIDS often arrive to the emergency department via ambulance or conveyed by family members. Local ambulance policy mandates that all children who have suffered a cardiac arrest will be conveyed to the local emergency department, often with resuscitation ongoing. It is unlikely you will see this presentation but may encounter it whilst on an emergency medicine block or a paediatrics block. If an infant dies suddenly and unexpectedly, there will need to be an investigation into how and why they died. A post-mortem investigation will usually necessary, which can be very distressing for the family. The police and healthcare professionals work closely to investigate unexpected infant deaths and ensure the family are supported. The Lullaby trust is a national charity the provides advice and support for bereaved families. Specially trained advisers are available on its helpline, 7 days a week.

SIDS is a potentially distressing presentation to hospital. If you encounter this presentation and feel affected by it. Please contact your placement supervisor, university student support or any of the support services offered by the local NHS trust you are allocated to.",Sudden infant death syndrome is rare but one of the most difficult presentations in Paediatrics.

Suicidal thoughts,PRES144,B,A,A,"Suicidal thoughts are common - 20 % of UK adults (surveyed 2014) have “seriously thought about ending their own lives” at some point, and many adolescents also report suicidal thoughts. Many people have thoughts about suicide without going on to harm themselves or end their lives, but predicting who might end their lives by suicide is difficult. Men are more likely to die by suicide (⅔ of deaths) than women, despite fewer presentations with non-fatal self-injury. The highest risk group in 2020 was men aged 45-49.
Studies have identified that many of the risk factors to suicide are social - factors such as stable relationships, employment, housing, and social connections are all protective. Suicide rates are also high amongst vulnerable groups who experience discrimination, such as refugees and migrants; indigenous peoples; LGBTQ people; and prisoners. By far the strongest risk factor for suicide is a previous suicide attempt. Suicide is not a “high income country” phenomenon - most suicides (77%) occur in low and middle income countries. Many people will seek help (50% will have seen GP in last 3 months) however only 41% will explicitly report suicidal ideation.
We cannot predict or prevent all suicide however by attending to our patients and their distress we can identify (1) mental illness which if treated can dramatically reduce the risk and (2) needs which if met may reduce risk. Think about what risk factors are modifiable (is there a treatable mental disorder? Is there a social stressor that could be addressed?) and what are not (prior history of suicide attempt, family history of suicide).","Suicidal thoughts (or acts) are common reasons to present to the Emergency Department. They can be seen in all mental disorders, so are seen commonly in psychiatric wards and clinics. Severe physical illness can be a cause for suicidal thoughts, so all doctors should be alert to the possibility some of their patients may develop suicidal thoughts. Even seemingly mild physical complaints may evoke suicidal thoughts if they are life-changing through threatening a person’s occupation - a tremor can be career ending for a person whose work involves fine motor control; mild arthritis can end athletic or manual working careers. Doctors have higher rates of suicide than other professions, and are especially at risk of suicide when complaints against them are being investigated by the GMC.", ,"Suicide is an important problem among older adults. WHO data shows that between 25-50% of all suicides are above the age of 55. Suicide attempts in older adults are far more likely to be successful: they plan more carefully and use more deadly methods; the elderly are less likely to be discovered and therefore rescued; the physical frailty of older adults means they are less likely to recover from an attempt. Risk factors include depression, prescription medications, physical illness, disability and pain, and social isolation. Talking to patients about suicidal ideation does not result in an increase in suicide attempts. Many opportunities for talking about depression and suicide are missed and Geriatric outpatients can be a good opportunity to explore these very sensitive issues.","CBD4 Overdose tutorial,CEL9: Reproduction & Pregnancy,Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Depression,Liaison Psychiatry,Mental health referral,Neuroscience and Mental Health:  Common Psychiatric Problems in Primary Care,Suicidal thoughts Case Based Discussion,Year 5 - Psychiatry,""Handbook of clinical psychopharmacology

Swallowing problems,PRES145,B,B,A,"Whilst swallowing problems may be a patient's primary complaint, it is important to screen patients with known neurological disease such as Parkinson's, stroke or dementia and refer appropriately to prevent the consequences of poor swallow such as malnutrition and aspiration. Ask about progressive changes in swallow in patients with speech or language difficulties or weakness. Review the 2WW pathway for patients with dysphagia, and think about the questions you would ask, examination required, and investigations required. Swallowing difficulty is common in end of life care- think about addressing the balance between a patient's choice to eat and drink for pleasure, and the risk of aspiration and choking, and the importance (usually in partnership with secondary and palliative care) of early discussions around clinically assisted nutrition and hydration.","Swallowing difficulty, commonly described as dysphagia, is a medical condition involved a series of sensory and motor nerve system. For each patient with suspected dysphagia or aspiration, detailed history is important. Some common symptoms at presentation like pain when swallowing, sense of food sticking to throat, coughing after drinking or eating. You can start with questions like “how long have these symptoms lasted?”, “difficulty in swallowing solid food or liquids or both?”, “do you feel food is going down or it is stuck at the back of tongue?” to have a better picture of dysphagia.

Dysphagia presentation always warrants further investigation of root causes. There are three phases of swallowing: oral preparation (cranial nerve IX), pharyngeal (mainly cranial nerve X) and oesophageal phase (peristalsis). For a patient with swallowing difficulties, inpatient speech and language therapy (SALT) team referral is necessary. The team offers assessment, specific advice, and targeted therapy tailored to a patient’s need. If necessary, barium swallow test should be the first test for investigation. Other methods such as naso-endoscopy, esophageal manometry or 24-hour pH study may be used.", ,"Dysphagia is typically referred to neurology or gastroenterology clinics. However, it is poorly recognised in older patients due to the constellation of symptoms they typically present with; indeed, the patient may not have recognised that they have dysphagia. It is important to ask patients and their relatives if they cough after eating or drinking. Patients who present with recurrent pneumonias may have silent aspiriations.

Threats to harm others,PRES146,B,A,A,"Threats to harm others will be rarely seen in primary care as a primary reason for consultation but might be detected because of some mental disorders or in cases of domestic violence. People with antisocial or paranoid personality disorders, or psychosis, might disclose plans to harm others (sometimes because they feel threatened themselves and may perceive a need to harm others to remain safe themselves). Try to determine whether the threats are related to an underlying medical condition, in which case there is a role for health services. If there is no evidence of an underlying condition, it can be helpful to document that there is no mental or other illness involved.","Threats to harm others can be seen in people brought to A&E by police, paramedics or family members, mostly in the context of acute legal or illegal drug intoxication, but sometimes in the context of severe mental illness such as a psychotic or manic episode. Psychosis and mania can lead patients to be irritable and disinhibited, and get into arguments or fall out with colleagues, family, neighbours, friends or house-mates, at which point there may be violent acts or threats to harm others. Psychiatrists may be asked by GPs or other colleagues to give opinions on patients threatening to harm others. Law courts or lawyers may ask psychiatrists to be expert witnesses in this context. Adult onset of violent behaviour, in a person who was placid and non-violent as a child and adolescent, is very unusual - think about an underlying cause, which could be organic, involve drug or alcohol misuse, or indicate the onset of schizophrenia.",No Paeds entry,"Patients with cognitive impairment (including delirium) may result in behaviours that threaten others. In addition, patients with a depression may experience intrusive thoughts when they think about harming others and then find this extremely upsetting. The risk of aggressive behaviour to others is increased 5 fold in patients with dementia, compared to a similar aged population. It is important to assess aggressive patients throughly, as non-articulated pain, constipation, urinary retention may all result is aggressive behaviour and may be managed simply rather than immediately prescribing sedative or anti-psychotic medication.","Bipolar Affective Disorder,CEL9: Reproduction & Pregnancy,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Personality disorder,Schizophrenia,""Handbook of clinical psychopharmacology

However, the symptoms may be distressing, and indicate underlying pathology including ENT diagnose e.g. Meniere's and ototoxicity/sclerosis, cardiac disease such as AV malformations, and conditions such as depression, thyroid disease and menopause. Patients may mention it during medication reviews, or attending for ear syringing at the practice. NICE recommend that all patients with tinnitus have a hearing test- how is this organised at your practice? What are the red flags that should prompt an urgent (<24 hrs or 2WW) or routine referral? What provision of 'tinnitus support' is there in the region? ","Tinnitus is perception of sound heard in the absence of physical sound sources that can be identified internally or externally. It can negatively affect the quality of life, causing irritability, anxiety, and depression. Tinnitus is usually caused by an underlying medical condition, such as age-related hearing loss, ear infection, ear canal blockage, head or neck injuries or medications. Other common causes of tinnitus are Meniere’s disease, Eustachian tube dysfunction (leading to imbalance of middle ear air pressure), ear bone damage, muscle spasm, temporomandibular joint disorder, acoustic neuroma, vascular disorder (such as atherosclerosis, stenosis), rheumatological diseases. At secondary care centre, a detailed history taking including medication and drug history is important.

Tremor,PRES148,B,A,A,"Tremor is the most common of movement disorders and may be an exaggerated physiological response. Whilst the majority of cases seen in General Practice will be due to Essential Tremor (0.4-6% of the population), it is important to be able to look for signs/symptoms of underlying pathology such as Parkinsonism, Cerebellar disease or tremor due to anxiety, hyperthyroidism etc. Consider what questions are important in the history, and what you will watch for as you invite the patient in from the waiting room, and whilst they speak to you. It is important to distinguish between the different types of tremor (i.e. rest versus action, tremor frequency and body distribution) and understand which examination techniques might help you distinguish an underlying cause.","People with tremor are typically seen in neurology clinics and care of the elderly clinics (which often include Parkinson’s services), where the reason for referral is ‘what is the underlying diagnosis’. However, tremor is common and you may encounter people with tremors in any ward of the hospital. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is more common with advancing age, and so care of the elderly wards will almost always have a few inpatients with PD although that may be unrelated to why they have come into hospital. Parkinson’s nurses work in the community and sometimes in hospitals too – how do they approach holistic aspects of Parkinson’s care? Essential tremor often improves with alcohol, and it is not uncommon to see the secondary consequences of that on the gastroenterology/hepatology wards.", ,"The notes from primary care apply entirely to older patients.

Unsteadiness,PRES149,B,A,A,"A vague term, but a common presentation in Primary Care, ‘unsteadiness’ encompasses everything from feeling faint and vertigo, to peripheral neuropathy and palpitations. Patients may present following a fall. More traditionally it is a term related to an ataxic gait which may be sensory, cerebellar or vestibular in nature, an apraxic gait related to frontal lobe dysfunction or a functional gait disorder perhaps related to a fear of falling. Given the long list of potential causes a clear history with clarification of the patient’s symptoms, and thorough examination including gait assessment are important. Think about how you might manage a patient presenting with unsteadiness- what investigations and referral pathways are open to you? Consider how you might identify patients at risk of falls in the community and how you might address this both at an individual and a population level.","Unsteadiness and dizziness can overlap somewhat in presentation so a clear history is key. Deterioration of walking and falls come under unsteadiness and are a common reason for referral to neurology clinics, and also to care of the elderly clinics. People may also present acutely following a fall to the ED or acute medical units. As well as the history, a full neurological examination including assessment for Parkinsonian signs is essential here. This will help differentiate peripheral from central causes, guiding appropriate further investigation. Don’t forget about the cervical spine again! Unsteadiness is not always neurological – eyes and ears are critical for balance too, and there are often multiple contributing factors as people age. Falls are a major concern in the elderly, associated with loss of independence and injury, so as well as trying to work out why people are falling, it is essential to consider how best to help them – personal alarms, physiotherapy and walking aids, key boxes, for example.", ,"Instability is one of the 'Geriatric Giants' and therefore may be thought of as a secondary symptom I.e. what is the underlying aetiology (see the primary care notes). Or has the older patient become unsteady due to a new trigger such as a UTI, dehydration, new medication, etc. A CT head may reveal cerebrovascular small vessel disease (which may be described as 'normal for age') though this may be contributing to the patient becoming progessively more unsteady. Consider discussing the patient with a physiotherapist- would a walking aid reduce the falls risk? Make sure you have looked at the patient's feet and assessed sensation. Check their shoes. Consider external factors such as poor vision. Perform a Hallpike's test to assess for BPPV.

When taking a history of urinary symptoms, ensure to clarify the exact nature of the symptoms present, establishing whether symptoms are mostly voiding or storage related as this can aid in determining the underlying pathology.
To ascertain the probable cause of urinary problems, ask about associated symptoms, such as visible haematuria, suprapubic discomfort, or colicky pain. Ask about their medication history, as certain medications including anticholinergics; antihistamines; and bronchodilators are known to exacerbate urinary symptoms. A digital rectal examination and/or examination of the external genitalia may be helpful, depending on the presentation.
Urinary symptoms in men are most commonly due to benign prostatic enlargement, whereas in women they are most caused by urinary tract infection. Ruling out non-urological pathology that may mimic urinary symptoms, such as polyuria secondary to diabetes mellitus is important. There are a range of conservative, medical and surgical management options depending on the underlying cause.","Urinary tract infections (UTI) can present with dysuria, frequency in children and should be investigated with urine dipstick, culture and treated with antibiotics. Follow the NICE guidelines when determining which patients require further evaluation of the urinary tract for recurrent/frequent UTIs. Other urinary symptoms in paediatrics include change in colour or type of urine such as haematuria, frothy urine and dark urine, which can indicate intrarenal pathology or hyperbilirubinemia. Diabetes Mellitus and Diabetes Insipidus can present with polyuria and polydipsia, the former will present with glycosuria on dipstick, while the latter will show dilute urine with low specific gravity on dipstick.","A somewhat broad term: incontinence, urinary frequency and urinary retention are all seen in Geriatric Medicine, and indeed, incontinence is one of the Geriatric Giants, or frailty syndromes. Up to 2/3rds of older women think incontinence is a part of normal ageing which it is not. In both men and women, the underlying aetiology of urinary incontinence is typically multi-factorial and may be elucidated by a careful detailed assessment. It is very important to exclude urinary retention in patients presenting with urinary frequency. UTIs are a common problem but are also over-diagnosed and over-atrributed to other presentations (eg confusion); a urine dipstick should not be used to diagnose a UTI; 25-50% of older women  and 15-40% of older men in long term care facilities have an asymptomatic bacteriuria. Tamsulosin is commonly prescribed for symptoms attributed to BPH but has considerable side effects of hypotension which can be very problematic in the frail older population. In addition, anti-cholinergic medication is frequently prescribed for urinary urgency and frequency and has very unwanted potential side effects; the efficacy of these medications must be assessed regularly rather than life-long continuation.","01 Overview of liver disorders talks - slides,01 Overview of liver disorders talks - video,02 Acute liver disorders - slides,02 Acute liver disorders - video,03 Chronic liver disorders - slides,04 Biliary liver disorders - video,05 Vascular liver disorders - slides,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injury webinar - Eve Robertson,""American Diabetes Association Issue """"Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes—2020"""""",Approach to Sepsis in Adults presenting in Primary Care,Assessment of a child under 5 with fever in primary care,Association of British Clinical Diabetologists homepage,Cambridge University Health Partners field overview video - Acute kidney injury - Akimichi Inaba,Cambridge University Health Partners field overview video - Diabetes update - Andrea Lake,Chronic Kidney Disease - Ruth Silverton,Common Presentations in Gynaecology,Common Presentations of Hepatology - Dr Fotios Sampaziotis,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Diabetes Mellitus - Catriona Davidson,Diabetes Therapy Dec 2017,Diabetes UK online forum - home,Diabetes UK page - Diabetes technology,Diabetes UK page - Diabetes: the basics,""Diabetes UK page - Diagnosis, ongoing management & monitoring"",Diabetes UK page - Driving and diabetes,Diabetes UK page - Joint British Diabetes Society for Inpatient care,Diabetic Emergencies - January 2014,Diabettech (diabetes technology information site) homepage,Difficulty walking seminar,Final Friday Neurology revision session,Gastrointestinal examinations,Global Oncology teaching session,Hepatology 'wiki' for clinical students      ,Hepatology 2 - biliary disorders (Will Gelson),History and examination: Evaluation of the Older Adult on MSD manual,Hypertonic Hyperosmolar coma,Immuno-deficiency 1,Immuno-deficiency 1,Immuno-deficiency 1,Inherited Liver Disease webinar - Bill Griffiths,JDRF page - Treatments & technologies,Liver tumours webinar - Matt Hoare,Managing Hepatology Emergencies as an FY1 (Catriona Davidson),Neurology is simple- how to avoid neurophobia seminar,Neurosurgery Lecture ONE - the spine,NICE - NG3 Diabetes in pregnancy: management from preconception to the postnatal period,NICE - NG17 Type 1 diabetes in adults: diagnosis and management,NICE - NG28 Type 2 diabetes in adults: management ,NICE - TA151 Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for the treatment of diabetes mellitus,NICE continence guidelines,Oncological Imaging in the Era of Precision Medicine lecture,Ovarian Disease,Ovarian Disease,Ovarian Disease,Parkinson's Disease in older adults,Polyuria/Diabetes,Polyuria/Diabetes,Polyuria/Diabetes,Practical Prescribing Year 4 Seminar,Practical Skills in Primary Care 4b GP tutorial,Prescribing snapshots - Rheumatology: vigilance for patients prescribed methotrexate,Renal Replacement Therapy - Ruth Silverton,Revision notes in metabolism,Sepsis lecture,""Session recording - Type 1 Diabetes, Dr E Gurnell"",""Session recording - Type 2 Diabetes, Dr E Gurnell"",""Slides - Type 2 Diabetes, E Gurnell"",""Slides - Type I Diabetes, Dr E Gurnell"",""Slides, Liver Tumours - Matt Hoare"",Specialist Medicine: Early Detection of Cancer,The Management of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Adults,Urogynaecology Maternal Health,Uropathology,Uropathology,Uropathology,Year 4 - Interviewing the Elderly Patient,Year 4 - Student Generated Scenarios,Year 6 - Shared Decision Making,Prescribing snapshot - Diabetes and endocrine drugs: Prescribing an IV insulin sliding scale,Prescribing snapshot - Renal Pharmacology: Adjusting regimes in AKI,Diabetes,NICE guidelines,Maternal & Child Health: Management of Menopausal Symptoms,Oncology extension teaching resources",87,GP,,"Abnormal urinalysis,Acute kidney injury,Dehydration,Oliguria,Urinary incontinence,Urinary symptoms","Acute and emergency,Obstetrics and gynaecology,Renal and urology,General practice and primary healthcare,Child health,Perioperative medicine and anaesthesia,Medicine of older adult,Surgery,Endocrine and metabolic,Infection,Neurosciences"
Vaginal bleeding,PRES151,C,A,A,"As with Menstrual Problems, vaginal bleeding may be a variant of normal, or a symptom of underlying pathology. Patients may present complaining of irregular bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding or post-coital bleeding as their primary complaint, or it may be mentioned as part of a contraception or HRT review, smear test, post-natal discussion, or when investigating a patient for causes of anaemia, pain on intercourse or infertility. GPs and midwives will often encounter vaginal bleeding during pregnancies and you may find it helpful to speak to them about how this is managed locally. Consider the questions you would ask patients with abnormal vaginal bleeding, the examination and investigations you would perform, and who you would refer to secondary care. Which patients qualify for a 2 week wait? Who should have an ultrasound or referred to the colposcopy clinic, and how urgently should this be done? Speak to the GPs and nurses about strategies for managing unwanted vaginal bleeding on contraceptives or HRT","Women with vaginal bleeding which is requiring investigation or is not controlled with the initial management offered in primary care may be referred.
Most women referred for assessment will attend a hysteroscopy clinic or colposcopy clinic. Where possible a one stop assessment is made performing ultrasound and hysteroscopy or colposcopy and biopsy on the same visit.
Occasionally presentations can be acute with heavy bleeding and as such may be seen in the Emergency department. Examples could be vaginal trauma following intercourse which may or may not have been consensual, or heavy menstrual bleeding complicated by fibroids.
In pregnancy the place of presentation depends on the gestation period. In early pregnancy women attend the early pregnancy unit or Emergency department for assessment of suspected miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. After the first trimester it is usual to present to the maternity department for assessment by the midwifery and obstetric team. Following birth up to 6 weeks postpartum women with abnormal bleeding also attend the maternity unit for assessment.", , ,"Abdominal Pain in Pregnancy,Anticoagulants,Common Presentations in Gynaecology,Complications in Labour,Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Gynae oncology,Maternal & Child Health: Contraception,Module 1 - Decision making and the cancer MDT,Oncological Imaging in the Era of Precision Medicine lecture,Puerperium and Postnatal Complications,RCOG Guidance,Genitourinary Medicine in the Community,Subfertility and Menstrual Problems,Vaginal Bleeding,Vaginal Bleeding,Vaginal Bleeding,Year 4 Core Clinical Method - Introduction to Gynaecology,Year 5 -- Specialist Medicine - TYAC & Communication Skills ,Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare,NICE guidelines,Oncology extension teaching resources",21,Obstetrics & Gynaecology (O&G),,"Bleeding antepartum,Bleeding postpartum","Acute and emergency,Obstetrics and gynaecology,Perioperative medicine and anaesthesia"
Vaginal discharge,PRES152,C,B,B,"Despite being a common symptom, and part of normal physiology, some patients may find vaginal discharge embarrassing to talk about. People may attempt to self-treat or use over the counter products before consulting with a healthcare professional. Discharge may be discussed during contraception reviews, discussions about fertility and pregnancy, and during smear tests. It is important to understand the impact of the menstrual cycle upon discharge, and how hormones during pregnancy, menopause and from contraception may alter it. What symptoms are concerning, and what assessment and management is available to patients in primary care, GUM, and gynaecology? Does the practice bring everyone in for assessment, or use self-taken low vaginal swabs? Speak to GPs and practice nurses about management of common conditions such as Candida & Bacterial Vaginosis and how they address recurrent symptoms and environmental/lifestyle factors. Be aware that vaginal discharge is also common in children, and how this is assessed.","Although vaginal discharge is an extremely common condition encountered in GP practices, Sexual health and O&G clinics, you are as likely to encounter it as an incidental symptom or a secondary complaint of a patient admitted in any other ward of the hospital. One might come across an elderly patient with a thick white vaginal discharge after antibiotic/steroid therapy on a respiratory ward or a patient with a smelly greenish discharge in the maternity day assessment unit. As many causes of vaginal discharge are physiological, many patients will not mention a vaginal discharge unless it is smelly, itchy, highly coloured or associated with pain.

Vaginal prolapse,PRES153,B,A,A,"Some patients may be reluctant to present with symptoms they find embarrassing, and as such it is important for the primary care team to be proactive in identifying vaginal prolapses at post-natal appointments, smear tests or when discussing menopausal, bowel or urinary symptoms. Be aware of the local services such as physiotherapy and pessary clinics, and speak to the practice nurses about their role in changing pessaries, and strategies such as education about pelvic floor exercises with women before prolapses develop. Be aware of the surgical options, and some of the recent controversies that may prevent patients from asking for referrals to Gynaecology.","Referrals to secondary care are seen by a gynaeolcogist or a specialist in urogynaecology, supported by specialist nurses and physiotherapists. Those requiring surgery will be admitted to a gynaeolcogy ward, though increasingly small procedures are managed with enhanced recovery or day care where possible.",No Paeds entry,"Although these patients may be referred directly to gynaecology, patients with these symptoms are frequently encountered in Geriatric clinics and wards. It is also common that the patient may not complain of this symptom, but that it is identified on examination or closed questions. The prolapsed tissue should be examined for evidence of ulceration or infection. Often, the patients seen in Geriatrics wards with a prolapse, lack capacity. The risk of surgery should be discussed with the patient if possible, but if they lack capacity, then the next of kin or power of attorney for health would be involved to make a 'best interests' decision. Usually a joint care approach with gynaecology and community nurse follow-up would be planned.","Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,RCOG Guidance,Urogynaecology Maternal Health,Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare,NICE guidelines",5,Obstetrics & Gynaecology (O&G),,Vaginal prolapse,"Obstetrics and gynaecology,Surgery"
Visual loss or change in vision,PRES154,B,B,A,"Sudden visual loss, that indicates a neurological or vascular cause, requires urgent assessment for ischaemia in most patients. Locally that may require referral to the TIA/stroke service, or acute medical unit. Be aware of the associated signs and symptoms that may suggest raised intracranial pressure, Migraine, seizure and Giant Cell Arteritis. Problems caused by damage to the eye itself including corneal abrasion, uveitis or retinal detachment may be seen by the Minor Eye Conditions Service or referred by a GP to eye casualty. Identifying where to refer on to is key for primary care clinicians- practice your basic assessment including general inspection, acuity, fields, pupils and ophthalmoscopy. Be aware of risk factors including medications, contact lenses, previous eye surgery and known vascular disease. ","Patients with visual loss are typically referred to ophthalmology by optometrists, general practice or the emergency department. The severity of visual loss should always be determined by assessing visual acuity (and visual fields when  indicated). There is a wide range of conditions causing visual loss which typically involves the visual media, retina or optic nerve.  It is useful to divide this patient presentation into sudden loss of vision and gradual loss of vision when considering potential causes.  It is important to identify patients with conditions requiring urgent treatment such as retinal detachment or giant cell arteritis.","The onset of visual loss or change is very important in assessing the underlying cause, which can range from myopia, infection, trauma and cranial nerve pathology. Assess severity by checking visual acuity, which can be done even in young infants by paediatric ophthalmologists, hence early referral is important. Examine eye movements carefully and take a thorough history including recent trauma and family history of myopia. Fundoscopy should be routinely performed, and any evidence of papilloedema should prompt neuroimaging to look for a space occupying lesion. ","A detailed history is essential as the differential is vast. Common and acute presentations not to be missed in older people include stroke, Giant cell arteritis and acute glaucoma. In chronic visual loss, minimising other falls risks is important, and remembering that some eye drops may have systemic side effects such as timolol leading to bradycardia. For inpatients, make an effort to check if older patients usually wear glasses, and if so, are they easily in reach? Check when an older patient last had their prescription checked- they may not have been able to get to an optician. Visual loss leads to poor quality of life, as well as probles, with medication, living independently etc, so it is important to consider function in an older patient with deteriorating vision: involve the MDT early to try and maximise independent living.","(PH3) Inequalities - Disability and Health,(PH4) Screening,""American Diabetes Association Issue """"Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes—2020"""""",Association of British Clinical Diabetologists homepage,""Bashari WA, Senanayake R, Fernández-Pombo A, et al.

Vomiting/nausea,PRES155,B,A,A,"Vomiting and nausea are very common and may be associated with other symptoms such as abdominal pain, change in bowel habit and headache, and can be due to multiple causes including infection, pregnancy, metabolic imbalance, neurological & psychological problems. The skill lies in identifying those patients in need of short-term medical support such as anti-emetics and rehydration, and ruling out potentially life threatening causes such as DKA, bowel obstruction or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Be aware of self-induced vomiting in eating disorders- see 'abnormal eating or exercise behaviour'.  Consider how to manage patients remotely, and what advice to provide them or parents/carers with regarding hydration, nutrition and deterioration in symptoms. Who would you want to see face to face? What medications may contribute to symptoms, and what should be stopped under 'sick day rules' to minimise the risk of acute kidney injury? Review the 2WW guidance for persistent vomiting and think about associated symptoms that may suggest malignancy. Vomiting & nausea are a common side effect of medication including chemotherapy and in palliative cases- speak to your tutor about management of the symptom and the role of the palliative care team.","Nausea and vomiting are commonly encountered in secondary care as a presenting complain or as an associated complain. As a presenting complain you will mostly encounter patients in A&E. It is usual acute and associated with a trigger (food poisoning, alcohol, new medications…). Exploring associated symptoms is critical, for example nausea and vomiting associated with loose stool is likely to be secondary to food poisoning. Ask the patient about their house hold and contact with unwell people. Rarely, nausea and vomiting can be the presenting symptoms for life threating conditions for example headache and vomiting after head trauma might suggest increased intracranial pressure and warrens a head CT.  Nausea and vomiting in the wards are usual secondary to medications or sedation. Morphine is notoriously associated with nausea and vomiting. Assessment and management of nausea and vomiting depends on four factors 1) the presence and degree of dehydration 2) the presence and degree of electrolyte disturbance 3) route availability 4) underlying aetiology. For example, patients presenting to A&E with nausea and vomiting with mild dehydration and are able to eat and drink can be managed conservatively with oral replacement while patients who are moderately to severely dehydrate who are unable to maintain adequate oral intake should be admitted for intravenous fluid therapy and should have bloods to assess their renal function and acid base balance and to guide fluid replacement.
Nausea and vomiting in the post-operative period should be adequately assessed and managed promptly as they are more prone to acute kidney injuries. The likely aetiology in the early post-operative period is sedation. However, it should be kept in mind that if illuis and abdominal obstruction should be kept in mind if nausea and vomiting does not settle or starts 24 hours post-op. Thus, when assessing a patient in the ward complaining of nausea and vomiting it is very important to take a focused history focusing on associated symptoms (abdominal pain, constipation, loose stool, recent medications including opioid, antibiotics…), examine the patients focusing on assessing the degree of dehydration, the presence or absence of abdominal tenderness. Listen for bowel sounds.","Nausea and vomiting are a common presentation of viral gastroenteritis in children in primary and secondary care. Always think about the risk for dehydration in a young child with vomiting, especially if the child also suffers with diarrhoea.","Again, a frequent symptom on the Geriatric wards and in geriatric clinic. A medication review is essential as polypharmacy is often a culprit. Minor electrolyte disturbance or dehydration may also lead to symptoms. The concern with older patients is that vomiting and nausea lead to hypotension and increased falls risk. In terms of symptom management, try non-pharmacological interventions as anti-emetics can have side-effects or interactions.

Vulval symptoms,PRES156,C,B,B,"Presenting in everyone from children to the elderly, vulval symptoms can be very distressing, and may go under reported due to embarrassment or cultural norms. Often patients will self-treat before seeing help, or be identified as having a problem when they attend for smear tests, or obstetric examination. Vulval symptoms aren’t always thrush- but may be put down to this infection by patients seeking over the counter treatment, or even healthcare professionals. Vulval symptoms are a common part of the menopause and may have a significant impact on an individual’s comfort and sex life. Children may present to health visitors or GPs with symptoms due to worms, or irritant dermatitis. Consider how we address the topic of sexual abuse and Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in children in particular, and red flags you may be looking for. Be aware of the presentations and examination findings of common conditions such as Herpes Simplex, Candida, Lichen Planus, Lichen Sclerosis, and consider who should be referred to exclude Vulval Intraepithelial Neoplasia. ","A referral will be made to a gynaecology clinic for women presenting to primary care who either need additional assessment as treatment in primary care has not resolved the problem, or because of suspicion of malignancy. Depending on a particular hospitals way of working these women may be seen in general gynaeolcogy clinics, in colposcopy, in a speciliast gynaecological oncology centre or in a vulval dermatlogy clinic.

Weakness,PRES157,B,A,A,"True weakness is an inability to perform a movement with normal force because of reduced muscle strength. Whilst this may be due to a primary neurological or neuromuscular condition, often patients describe weakness or malaise in relation to almost any other condition including chronic disease, such as heart failure, malignancy, COPD, CFS/ME or acute illness such as dehydration or sepsis. As such, this is a common presentation within primary care, across urgent 'on-the-day appointments' to chronic conditions reviews. Speak to the team at the surgery about how possible neurological emergencies such as stroke are managed when a patient phones the surgery. Consider which patients need seeing face to face for assessment for objective weakness, what clinical signs you would examine for, and the possible acute causes that would prompt emergency admission or imaging. In more chronic presentations without objective muscle weakness, think about what you would do, which investigations you may order, and how you would follow a patient up. What support is available within the community to support patients who are struggling with reduced muscle strength?","True muscle weakness is usually referred to neurology, though rheumatologists also see many people with muscle disorders. Weakness can lead to falls, so you will see this in the ED, stroke unit, care of the elderly wards and many general medical wards. The key is in determining whether this is a problem in the muscle, the lower motor neurones or the upper motor neurones, and whether the cranial nerves are involved too. That means a full neurological examination, which will definitely require a tendon hammer! The history will give clues as to the underlying cause – sudden (eg. stroke, disc), subacute (eg. MS, Guillain barre, myasthenia) or chronic (eg. motor neurone disease, myopathies) but it is the examination that will tell you which areas of the nervous system are involved and how to investigate further. Think about when neurophysiology (nerve conduction studies and electromyogram) may be helpful. What is the role for blood tests, imaging and lumbar puncture?", ,"As described in the primary care block, 'weakness' is a common complaint, also in the older population. It is a vague complaint which needs a holistic approach to make more concrete. Acute unilateral weakness may be the result of a stroke, and needs urgent assessment and investigation. A generalised feeling of weakness, depiste a lack of hard neurological weakness, may be the only presentation of serious underlying pathology. A full blood screen is essential including inflammatory markers. Part of normal ageing includes a gradual loss of muscle strength and sarcopenia, but some older patients experience more severe symptoms than others. Sarcopenia is part of the frailty syndrome and is defined as a progressive and generalised skeletal muscle disorder that involves accelerated loss of muscle mass and function, associated with weakness and loss of function, more common in advanced age. It is worth noting that 10 days of hospital bed rest is thought to result in the equivalent of 10 years of muscle ageing. The key message from this is that if a patient is already weak when they are admitted, without daily physio, they will be weaker on discharge.","""Application of Genetics in Endocrinology, pt 1 - Dr Ruth Casey"",""Application of Genetics in Endocrinology, pt 2 - Dr Ruth Casey"",""Article: Ball S, Barth J, Levy M; Society for Endocrinology Clinical Committee.

Weight gain,PRES158,B,A,A,"Patients will often discuss unwanted weight gain as a concern in a consultation, sometimes in isolation, sometimes in relation to changes in mood, the post-natal period, during the menopause or as a consequence of reduced activity/immobility after illness or injury. Are there services locally that the population can self-refer into? Speak to your tutor about how they approach weight gain in a consultation, especially given the stigma and shame that are sometimes encountered. Evidence suggests that patients, despite our concerns, welcome the opportunity to discuss their weight. What information is helpful  in the weight history? Be aware of how this is monitored at the practice in babies and children, and during medication reviews. What signs or symptoms might have you consider an underlying diagnosis such as heart failure, thyroid disease or PCOS? Which co-morbidities would you assess for and how? Discuss with the team at the practice the strategies they have access to support their patients,  including brief interventions and referrals to commercial weight loss programmes. Be aware of the 4 tiers of obesity service in Scotland, Wales & England and think about which patients should be referred where. Remember that weight gain may be a positive (and healthy) thing for some people who have previously lost weight due to malnutrition, malignancy, chronic disease and infection. ","While weight gain is a common , mostly benign, complaint in the community, presenting to secondary care with weight gain warrens further investigations. History and examination are  the corner stones of making a diagnosis. Determining the onset and progression of weight gain is critical. On one hand, patients presenting to  accidents and emergencies (A&E) with new weight gain that developed over few days and associated with shortness of breath and peripheral oedema are likely to be fluid overloaded (hypervolemic). On examination, those patients might have increased jugular venous pressures, fine basal crackles and pedal oedema. They might have as well fluid shift to third space/ body cavities for example pleural effusions or ascites. This group of patients require urgent assessment and usual require admission for further investigations and management. A basic assessment includes full blood count, renal function, liver function, Nt-pro-BNP and a urine dip to assess for proteinuria. Additionally, all patients who present with weight gain and hypervolemia should have a chest x-ray and an electrocardiogram. Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) assessment should be considered for assessing volume status. You will mostly encounter these patients in A&E, in cardiology wards and clinics, renal wards, gastroenterology wards and intensive care units. On the other hand, patients gaining weight over several months or years are likely to have increased calories intake which is mostly secondary to lifestyle and rarely due to primary medical pathologies for example hypothyroidism or hypothalamic syndrome.  A careful history taking and building rapport with your patients is very important as many patients feel embarrassed and guilty over their weight gain. Try to understand their concerns and ideas of what might be the cause of their weight gain. Look for red flags in history (headaches, symptoms of hypoglycaemia (sweating, shaking, palpitations relived by eating), uncontrollable hunger, new masses) that might point for malicious causes. Additionally, it is very important to take a full medication history as weight gain is a common side effect for multiple medications for  example steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs). It is important in this group of patients to screen for co-morbidities and complications associated with weight gain for example diabetes, hypertension,  hyperlipidaemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Weight gain should be treated as a medical issue and thus management should be discussed with the patients. Using motivational interviewing techniques can aid lifestyle modifications and weight loss. It is very important as well to educate the patient about the availability of medical and surgical options if weight loss cannot be achieved with lifestyle modifications.

Weight loss,PRES159,B,A,A,"An important symptom to identify in patients presenting for a multitude of reasons due to its association with malignancy, psychological diagnoses and inflammation, the continuity afforded by primary care allows an observation of an individual's weight over time. Unexpected or unusual weight loss as the primary presentations or together with changes in bowel habit, cough, low mood, abnormal sweating etc. requires thorough assessment. Speak to your tutor about the investigations and referral pathways (including 2WW) you may use. What are your options if weight loss remains unexplained but initial investigations such as bloods/FIT/Chest X rays are normal? Weight loss is common with sarcopenia and frailty- given the increased risk of falls, loss of independence and increased mortality, think about community teams that should be involved with elderly patients who are losing weight, irrespective of the underlying cause. Speak to your tutor about the experience of managing patients with eating disorders in primary care, and involvement of community eating disorder services- see ""abnormal eating or exercise behaviour"". Weight loss in new-borns is common and even expected, but be aware that it can be concerning, and ask about how weight loss in children can be monitored and investigated- see ""Faltering Growth"".","Unexpected weight losses a non specific symptom that can be perceived as signs of a variety of pathological or psychological disorders. In a secondary care setting, a patient with an unexpected weight loss may be referred to an endocrinologist, rheumatologist, psychiatrist or even an oncologist. Such patients usually present to their GP, instead of the A&E or acute medicine units and referral to secondary care relies on multiple characteristics like age, risk factors and differentials and any other associated symptoms. For e.g; if a patient presents to the GP with a history of abnormal weight loss and associated nocturia and increased thirst, the next course of action would be consider a differential diagnosis of diabetes or even hyperthyroidism. In another scenario, a patient with unexpected weight loss with history of low mood and a positive family history of psychiatric disorders can be evaluated by a psychiatrist for an Eating Disorder, Depressive symptoms, or anxiety. Weight loss doesn’t always have to point towards malignancy although it is one of the key symptoms in making cancer diagnosis especially in the elderly and/ or in the people with significant risk factors. It is vital to have ask for a thorough history and carry out proper clinical examination before coming to a conclusion as specificity of such a symptom is very low and to avoid putting the patients through various high tech or invasive investigations. ", ,"Weight loss is common presentation in general Geriatric Clinics though a recent audit in Addenbrookes Hospital showed that the differential for this presentation is wide. It is important to establish objective evidence of weight loss (previous weight recorded in the notes, or whether clothing has become too big). Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment will usually identify the cause which may be medical, social, psychological, environmental or iatrogenic. Assuming sinister causes have been excluded, then dietary supplements such as high calorie drinks may be indicated. Always do a very thorough examination to ensure nothing is missed (including examining for lymphadenopathy, PR examination and a breast examination)","(HB8) Clinical Aspects of Nutrition,Acute Kidney Injuries,Acute Kidney Injuries,""American Diabetes Association Issue """"Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes—2020"""""",Anorexia Pathway Recorded Lecture - Dunecan Massey,""Application of Genetics in Endocrinology, pt 1 - Dr Ruth Casey"",""Application of Genetics in Endocrinology, pt 2 - Dr Ruth Casey"",Arthritis,Arthritis,Arthritis,Article: Arlt W; Society for Endocrinology Clinical Committee.

Wheeze,PRES160,A,A,A,"Wheeze may be the primary concern of the patient or their parent/carer, or it may be something you identify from your history and examination when a patient presents with breathlessness, ankle swelling or cough. It is common, particularly in young children, and distinguishing viral wheeze due to upper respiratory tract infection from conditions such as asthma involves adopting a ""probability-based approach"". Find out how wheeze is managed & followed up in primary care in children, and think about what resources to use to safety-net in cases such as bronchiolitis. Ask reception about how patients with wheeze and breathing difficulty are triaged, and talk through the initial emergency management of acute asthma. When would you order a chest X-ray or bloods? Can the practice perform spirometry in patients with wheeze? Ask to observe asthma/COPD reviews, and speak to the respiratory lead for the practice about the use of inhalers for prevention and relief of symptoms. Do patient have rescue medication for exacerbation of symptoms, and how do we minimise overuse?","Wheeze is a common symptom caused by narrowing of airway. It may present as a solitary symptom or associated with breathlessness in asthmatic patients. Although it is most commonly seen in asthmatics, wheeze may be part of numerous other diseases that have resulted in narrowing or obstruction of airway, namely, mucosal edema, foreign body obstruction or a tumour.
Wheezing may be acute or chronic, and therefore it is important to extract appropriate and accurate history to come to a conclusion as to what may be causing the problem. Radiological investigation like a chest X-ray or CT scans may help out rule any sort of mechanical airway obstruction. In a secondary care setting, such a presenting symptom may be referred to a pulmonology specialist, paediatrician in case of children presenting with wheeze or an oncologist. The referral to the right specialist is vital to avoid any sort of undue delay in making the accurate diagnosis and the treatment provided to the patient.", , ,"Acute presentations in primary care Year 4 Seminar,Assessment of a child under 5 with fever in primary care,Asthma and COPD - Dr Marianne Phillips - 16th April 2020,Breathlessness and Cyanosis,Breathlessness and Cyanosis,Breathlessness and Cyanosis,Bristol Medical School respiratory exam video,British Thoracic Society Guideline for Bronchiectasis in Adults,British Thoracic Society Guidelines for Home Oxygen Use in Adults,British Thoracic Society/SIGN British Guideline on the Management of Asthma,Bronchiectasis and lung cancer - Dr Parth Patel - 1/6/20 ,Cardiovascular and Peripheral Vascular examinations,""Chest Radiology, an introduction seminar"",Additional Core Reading Textbooks by specialty - Medical Library,Emphysema - Dr Thomas Pulimood and Dr Nicola Newman,Haemoptysis,Haemoptysis,Haemoptysis,Interstitial Lung Disease and Bronchiectasis - Dr Catriona Davidson,Maternal & Child Health: Common Childhood Encounters in Primary Care,NICE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in over 16s: diagnosis and management,""NICE: Smoking: acute, maternity and mental health services"",Peadiatrics - Respiratory,Practical Skills in Primary Care 4b GP tutorial,Prescribing snapshot - Respiratory drugs: a reducing dose of prednisolone,Pulmonary Pathology Index - The Internet Pathology Laboratory  for Medical Education,Radiology Masterclass website - Chest X-ray Abnormalities,Radiology Tutor website,Radiopaedia website - cases and imaging,Resp.net resources page,Respiratory examinations,Respiratory drugs,Respiratory section of AnaesthesiaUK,Slide deck - Wheezing,Slides - Bronchiectasis and Lung Cancer,Slides - Interstitial Lung Disease and Bronchiectasis,Spirometry site - understanding this lung fuction test,University of Washington Images in Pathology,Wheeze - Dr Harriet Mark - 7th May 2020,Year 5 seminar: Respiratory Technique,Recommended Cardio-respiratory medicine texts,Oncology extension teaching resources,Chest x-ray,eBook for Undergraduate Education in Radiology (ESR),www.learningradiology.com,Radiology Assistant,Radiology Cafe,Radiology Masterclass,Radiopaedia,Radiology Masters,3D printing and Radiology",51,Medicine,,Wheeze,"Acute and emergency,Cardiovascular,Child health,Respiratory,General practice and primary healthcare"
